# Browser host

This directory contains the **Node host for browser development and tests**.
It is checked-in source, not browser-compatible application code, a cache, a
production browser backend or another relay server. Packaged desktop uses the
native Rust host in `src-tauri/`; shared application logic stays in `src/`.
Development tooling lives in `scripts/`, including the
[developer-settings Vite plugin](../scripts/developer-settings.ts) and
[live setup probe](../scripts/live-setup-probe.mjs).

See [shared logic and host boundaries](../docs/contributing.md#shared-logic-and-host-boundaries)
for the runtime/identity matrix, ownership rules and cross-host test expectations.
Keep platform-neutral feature policy under its existing `src/features/*` owner;
retain host custody and boundary enforcement here. Existing tests are discovered
by Vitest. [Broker setup](../README.md#relay-channels) requires an explicit public
identity pin; never put a private key in environment configuration. Preserve
supported browser capabilities while consolidating duplicate implementations.
Use the native path for native acceptance and browser workflows to validate
browser support; see the [consolidation guidance](../docs/contributing.md#broker-consolidation-and-completion).
