# Agents: current-Buzz compatibility V1

## Scope

V1 **reuses the current Buzz library and mentions existing agents in channels
and threads**. No migration to relay-only storage. Creation, editing,
add-existing membership, Save/recovery and all runner management are out of V1.

### Implemented compatibility view

- The macOS live development broker reads the installed Buzz library at
  `~/Library/Application Support/xyz.block.buzz.app/agents/managed-agents.json`.
  It does not search/merge the separate `.dev` library, read agent keys from
  Keychain, write the file, run migrations, or call old loaders with side effects.
- Only definition ID/name, identity public key/name/definition link, and optional
  avatar artwork leave the host. Prompts, configuration, credentials and execution receipts are not
  projected. This is local library evidence, **not verified ownership**.
- Selected definitions remain one card each, including definitions without an
  identity. Exact linked keys remain available in each card’s identity disclosure, including namesakes; unlinked and
  unmatched identities use Custom agents/Other identities groupings. Unlike old Buzz's
  runtime-dependent representative selection, this read-only view shows all
  non-archived linked keys and has no profile/start action or running badge.
- Confirmed relay archives hide identity rows, not definition cards. Missing
  archive evidence is labeled; it does not erase the saved library. This is
  display behavior, never mention permission.
- One lazy host read per opening/Refresh; no polling or relay-directory startup
  scan. Concurrent host requests coalesce. Read caps: 8 MiB / 2000 records;
  malformed/missing files fail visibly without echoing their contents. The host
  projects from JSON, so private fields may transiently exist in host memory;
  there is no claim that JavaScript strings are zeroized. Browser reads time out
  at ten seconds and session disposal/cache/access/disconnect fences clear them.
- The page uses only `session.agentLibrary` and `session.archives`. Unused relay
  ownership/configuration readers and native recovery code have been removed.
- Avatars use saved library artwork, with initials on missing/failed images.
  Optional artwork accepts HTTPS without credentials or bounded raster data URLs,
  never file URLs or SVG data. Relay media uses the existing session media helper;
  CSP is unchanged. No extra profile scan or polling is added.

Source parity pinned at old Buzz `b9392d9d78744df365f9276e1ffe8c1baa5ea903`:
`desktop/src/features/agents/ui/AgentsView.tsx:221–253`,
`lib/catalog.ts:3–12`, `ui/unifiedAgentGroups.ts:16–47`,
`desktop/src-tauri/src/managed_agents/storage.rs:239–283`,
`types.rs:180–209`. Old `load_personas` can update builtins and write back; this
adapter deliberately only reads the persisted post-fold library. It does not
port builtin refresh, live runtime ordering or Teams.

### Ready-to-try workflow / remaining acceptance

Use the public `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` pin and `BUZZ_LIVE=1 just desktop` from the
README; fixture/default startup cannot show the live local library. No private
keys in environment files. Keep existing Buzz running: this app does not launch
or supervise ACP.

1. Compare Agents with installed Buzz's selected library; Refresh after changing
   that library in Buzz. Stop state should not remove cards. Duplicate display
   names must retain distinct exact keys.
2. In a channel where the agent is already a member, select it from `@`
   suggestions and send a short prompt; confirm the reply from the same key.
3. Repeat in a thread and confirm the reply lands in that thread.

Browser fixtures cover library rendering/retry/session replacement and actual
channel/thread composer publication, **not a live ACP reply**. Manual feedback
reported a working live path, but a separately observed native/ACP trace,
packaged acceptance and the final integration gate remain outstanding. Earlier
envelope/fixture validation does not certify the later compatibility adapter.


## Exact channel-member mentions

The shared channel summary now exposes exact members from its existing verified
relay-authored kind-39002 roster, without a second directory or subscription.
The bundled **Mentions** plugin offers **Mention a member** in both channel and
thread composers through the shared conversation tool contract. The host retains
recipient intent, disclosure and removal even when the chooser plugin is disabled.
The picker shows keys alongside names (namesakes remain separate), reads optional
profiles only on demand, and keeps selected identity spans in scoped drafts.
Typing a name alone does not notify anyone. Editing a selected span removes its
notification intent. Native beforeinput ranges preserve untouched spans; missing
range evidence, IME/history edits and collapsed deletions clear selections rather
than guess. Even a same-text replacement drops the edited identity. Explicit recipient
chips show who will be notified and can be removed without deleting the prose.

`session.messages.send/reply` accepts up to 32 exact pubkeys and emits deduplicated
`p` tags. Selection never invites someone. Current roster membership is checked at
intent, before signing, and after signing before entering the transport publisher;
retry/restored signed intent uses the same publisher check. Before **each**
mention publication the session performs a bounded foreground finite read of this
channel's kind-39002 roster under the captured relay author. It never joins an
older in-flight read. Empty/failed/malformed evidence blocks dispatch; access,
connection and cache changes fence the read. A newer observed removal beats an
older response. Neither AUTH, route establishment nor the optional metadata-read
status substitutes for this preflight. Failed/capacity-limited live routes can use
the finite evidence while connected. One finite request per mention attempt is a
safety cost, not additional startup work or polling.

A first known local rejection is failed/unsent. Finite membership preparation runs
under the same outbox deadline but outside the dispatch phase: a timeout there is
unsent and starts no confirmation reads. The final synchronous scope/membership
check runs immediately before publisher entry, after all asynchronous preparation.
A blocked retry preserves prior
unknown/accepted delivery evidence and reports its retry error separately; the
first dispatched attempt may already have delivered. These checks are client UX safety,
not a substitute for relay authorization, a membership transaction, or the ACP
listener's own admission rules. Network changes after transport dispatch remain
possible. No ownership or running status is inferred from a member's name/profile.

Wire compatibility is kind 9 + `h` + exact `p`; direct replies also carry
`["e", root, "", "reply"]`. Existing buzz-acp owns mention admission, replay,
channel membership, pool wake and harness execution. This slice adds no wake loop,
process launcher, configuration save or agent invitation operation. The local library and archive display are not mention authorization.

Focused coverage: `mentions.test.ts`, `MessageComposer.test.tsx`,
`mention-draft.test.ts`, broker sign/publish integration and the real React journey
`tests/browser/mentions.spec.mjs` and `mention-edit.spec.mjs` (Chromium + WebKit,
fixture identities). `mentions-live.test.ts` exercises the actual subscription →
session → outbox path across reconnect, route failures, stale/failed preflight,
restore, optional name failure and unknown delivery. Live ACP
reply and packaged desktop acceptance are not established by these tests.


## Relay-scoped archive display

`session.archives` is a lazy read-only NIP-IA snapshot capability, independent of
page/plugin lifetime. The dev broker passes `archiveAuthority` only when the
community's NIP-11 advertises a valid explicit `self`; the legacy contact `pubkey`
fallback continues to serve existing reads but cannot authenticate archive state.
The host-supplied signed transport does not yet discover NIP-11 and therefore
leaves this capability unavailable. No secret crosses the browser boundary.

One fresh background read requests kind 13535 from that exact authority, limit 1.
The verified response must contain exactly one empty-content, protected snapshot
within 2 MiB. Missing/failed/malformed/oversized evidence is unknown, never an empty
active list. Invalid `p` keys are ignored and extra `p` elements have no semantics.
A successful snapshot replaces the entire list; newer timestamps / lower-id ties
win. A session-local ordering fence survives cache clear, without retaining old
archive contents; it is not persistent rollback protection across sessions/devices.
Access purge, disconnect, cache clear and disposal clear evidence and cancel work.
No startup request, periodic poll, event-union seeding or history filtering is added.

This is finite evidence, not a live archive directory.
My agents consumes it for display; the member mention picker relies on actual
channel membership, not identity archive filtering. `not-archived` means absent from the read snapshot, not online,
owned, authorized or guaranteed current at a later write. Archive/unarchive writes,
delta processing, native discovery and packaged/live acceptance remain separate.
Protocol source: old Buzz `b9392d9` `docs/nips/NIP-IA.md`, especially relay identity,
snapshot format and snapshot/delta consistency. Tests use the actual session and
HTTP broker/verified transport, including corrupted signature rejection.

## Current feedback round and deferred validation

Composer: grouped @/emoji controls on the left, circular send on the right,
quieter recipient chips and compact avatar suggestions. No placeholder actions,
rich-editor migration or changed notification semantics. Cards use squircle
avatars, short labels and expandable exact keys; no running/ownership badge.

This feedback round passes typecheck, targeted Biome, 118 focused adapter/session/
envelope/composer checks, and the Agents + channel/thread mention journeys in
Chromium and WebKit (4 browser checks). The agent fixture checks loaded artwork
and the exact-key disclosure. Locked Cargo metadata resolves for Apple Silicon
macOS after dependency pruning; no native compilation was run.
Broader scan/native/package checks and independent compatibility-adapter review
remain deferred until an agreed integration batch. Do not gate ordinary visual
feedback on them. Broader agent architecture proposals are outside the V1 scope.
