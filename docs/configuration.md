# Deployment configuration: current-feature parity

Buzz Foundation supports configuration for capabilities that exist here, not a
port of every OG Buzz feature. Keep deployment values in local/CI configuration,
not in source. Build defaults are readable binary data, **never secret storage**.

## Supported inputs and surfaces

| Input | Consumer and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ENV` | Native build: allowlisted multiline Databricks host/model/filter defaults. Runtime, OAuth/discovery and editor share one compiled floor. |
| `BUZZ_BUILD_BUZZ_AGENT_PROVIDER` | Native build: lowest-precedence Buzz Agent provider, never a default for other harnesses. |
| `BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ACCESS_OWNER_ONLY` | Native build: presence-only local listener policy clamp, including saved/imported agents. |
| `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` | Live development broker's default community, not an agent relay override or a packaged default. |
| `BUZZ_BUILD_AUTO_CONNECT_DEFAULT_RELAY` | Presence-only alias for fresh-viewer community selection in live development only. Saved viewer choice wins. |
| `BUZZ_DEV_OPEN_RELAY` | Development-specific override of that alias: only `1` enables; `0` explicitly opts out. Requires a relay URL and live viewer pin to have an effect. |
| `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER`, `BUZZ_COMMUNITY_ALIASES`, `BUZZ_DEV_NOTIFICATIONS` | Existing public viewer pin, public routing aliases and dev notification override; unchanged. See the [development setup](contributing.md). |

The three native inputs read only repository-root `.env.local` plus explicit
process values. Process presence wins, even empty. No `.env.production`, arbitrary
environment passthrough or runtime environment inheritance is added. See the
[agent-default precedence and example](agent-control.md#nonsecret-build-defaults).
Restart/rebuild native code to change compiled defaults. Restart Vite to change
broker/routing configuration. Browser-only builds have no native agent controller;
production frontend builds neither load the dev broker nor expose the auto-open
seed. Native settings do not enter Vite `define` or runtime-resource builds.

An unset provider build flag does not select Databricks on behalf of an existing
blank agent. The Create form retains its existing Databricks suggestion when no
provider floor exists. Supplying a provider floor leaves the saved selector blank
so later build defaults can take effect. Saved explicit settings remain explicit.

## Deliberate exclusions

Inventory source: `block/buzz-releases` at
`af57fbf40b50941c03cef2466b1e6970ab6bc779` (`.buildkite/pipeline*.yml`,
`scripts/build-macos.sh`, mobile helpers, `scripts/lib.sh` and publishing helpers),
compared with OG `block/buzz` at
`99c2acf90cfbb1cb2d3a8bd900c0ec1642e20540` (`desktop/src-tauri/build.rs` and its
runtime consumers). No deployment-specific values from those repositories are
copied here.

| OG/release input | Why it is not implemented here |
| --- | --- |
| `BUZZ_DESKTOP_BUILD_RELAY_URL`; packaged auto-connect | Packaged human signing/relay host capability is not implemented. Baking a URL cannot provide it. The existing dev broker and saved agent destinations remain separate. |
| `BUZZ_BUILD_RELAY_RECONNECT_CMD` | No reconnect-command feature; arbitrary deployment command execution is not added. |
| `BUZZ_UPDATER_ENDPOINT`, `BUZZ_UPDATER_PUBLIC_KEY` and helper fallback aliases | No updater feature. Public verification configuration belongs with that future feature; private signing keys never belong in app defaults. |
| `--features mesh-llm` | No mesh/provider integration in this local controller; unsupported imported mesh/team/remote agents still fail closed. |
| `BUZZ_BUILD_OBSERVER_ARCHIVE_DEFAULT`, `BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_METRIC_ARCHIVE_DEFAULT` | Already no-ops in inspected OG: its archive capability checks return true for all builds. This app does not claim equivalent archive collection by accepting inert flags. |
| Build-command `BUZZ_ACP_ALLOWED_RESPOND_TO`, `BUZZ_ACP_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_ADD_POLICIES` | OG consumers are runtime-only; setting these around compilation does not bake them. The supported owner-only capability uses the existing local listener enforcement boundary instead. |
| Mobile `BUZZ_AGE_GATING_ENABLED`, Android `BUZZ_ANDROID_RELEASE_SIGNING=external` | No corresponding Flutter/Android target in this app. |
| CI version/tag metadata, artifact paths/upload controls, signing teams/profiles, Apple/App Store/Artifactory/Play credentials, Android signer roles/sockets, SDK/JDK/toolchain settings, Tauri bundle/config arguments | Release infrastructure and packaging controls, not product defaults. No new build-variable forwarding API. |

Ignored `.env.local` can contain unrelated development settings, but only the
three allowlisted native keys are compiled. Unknown keys **inside**
`BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ENV` fail closed instead of silently implying support. Do not
use any build input for private keys, tokens or raw agent configuration.
