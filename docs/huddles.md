# Huddles plugin

**Huddles** is enabled by default on macOS desktop and can be turned off in
Settings → Plugins. Click the headphone button immediately after members in a
channel or DM header to join the latest available Huddle or start one when none
is found. The Huddle window opens and receives focus by default once connected. The mini
player stays visible beside search at the same time. Closing the window or using
its minimize control keeps audio connected; the mini player can reopen and focus it. If opening fails, the mini player stays available to retry. No side panel opens
and the header shows a green headphone/divider/chevron capsule only in the chat
where your call is connected. While a connection is pending, the header button offers Cancel Huddle connection; canceling releases audio and ignores a late connection result. Its headphone changes to a leave icon on hover or
keyboard focus, and clicking leaves the call. Elsewhere the neutral headphone
focuses the existing player. Its Add someone menu opens the existing member
picker for the Huddle's private room. Adding someone grants access to the room's
audio and thread, including when the Huddle started in a DM; the original chat's
membership and messages remain private. The copied Buzz channel link still opens
the original chat and is only useful to its existing members. Microphone access
follows the explicit Join click.

Room invitations require the parent marker written by this app; Add someone is
unavailable on older unmarked rooms. The recipient uses the relay's signed global
44100 membership notice, checks its target, inviter, current room membership and
parent metadata, then presents the existing incoming request in both views. The
notice may arrive before discovery grants local room access, so the finite recovery
reads by relay author and recipient, without a channel filter. Requests from before
this activation, self-adds, archived rooms and ordinary channels do not ring.
Joining an existing room can use its signed roster or the original chat's roster;
creating a new Huddle still requires membership in the original chat. When audio
auto-admission adds a parent-chat member without publishing discovery, the client
confirms its own room membership with a role-preserving 9000 after the audio
handshake, then re-reads the signed roster. This happens only when that room's
initial signed roster did not include the viewer; it also emits the relay's normal
member-joined notice. A failed confirmation reports an incomplete join instead of
granting local chat write access from audio participation alone. The audio
relay remains authoritative for creator linkage and current admission. Explicit
access revocation ends the call even during an incomplete roster refresh. Admission
retains its original authority: a parent-admitted call still requires current parent
membership after automatic room admission; a room-only invite retains room authority.

The mini player matches the neighboring 28px shell controls, with matching internal
buttons, 16px regular-weight icons and 20px avatars. Its end buttons sit flush
against the outer edges, with 4px before the microphone and no gap on either side of the Audio settings/Leave divider. Waveform and avatar content has
4px padding, with an extra 4px on the waveform’s left side. It uses the shared
primary glass material from the shell controls and offers audio activity, an
avatar stack of actual participants, mute, and a text-only Leave button. Leave keeps its Red 10 label with a muted red
fill on hover and is separated from Audio settings by a subtle divider flush against both button containers.
The divider hides while either adjacent button is hovered.
The neutral glass controls use the white chrome hover in light mode and its dark-mode counterpart.
The proposed `text-call-leave` role preserves the requested Red 10 in both themes.
It is a documented contrast exception for these controls: the light-mode Leave
label measures 3.09–4.37:1 across its opaque fills; dark-mode APCA is Lc 35.2–40.4.
Glass depends on its backdrop and is not certified by those opaque measurements.
The separate window uses matching neutral gray controls for microphone and Leave,
with a Red 10 Leave icon.
New arrivals slide
and scale into the front of the stack; reduced motion removes that movement. The
latest four avatars remain visible, with a matching avatar showing the count for other participants. Click the
waveform or avatars once connected to open the
separate Huddle window. The window borrows mobile’s avatar-cloud layout: you are centered alone, then
move left as other participants gather on the right. Up to ten peers use the
mobile-inspired cluster’s varied avatar sizes, with an overflow count for larger calls.
Names appear on hover or keyboard focus. Nearby portraits shift aside for the
active name capsule, then settle back when it closes. Only one name is shown
at a time; reduced motion makes the layout change immediate.
A soft halo around each speaker eases between audio levels with a restrained expansion,
responding to their own microphone or received audio,
then fades after speech stops. The window uses these halos instead of a footer
waveform; the compact player keeps its waveform. Muting clears only your halo.
Arrivals fade and scale in; reduced motion removes those transitions. Closing that window or navigating to another conversation
keeps audio connected. Leave releases the microphone and closes the companion.
Native call completion also retires it after a renderer reload/crash. The companion
has no identity, signing or microphone permissions. Failed companion updates also report their error in the main app toast stack,
instead of silently ignoring the chat button. Connection failures appear
in the shared app toast stack without showing the compact player; the headphone
button can retry them, and dismissing the notice clears the failed call.

Disabling the plugin, losing channel access, replacing the relay session, or
switching community ends the local call. If the UI disappears, the native call
expires after its client heartbeat stops. A failed audio connection exposes a
manual join retry. Recent-room discovery is advisory: it uses signed lifecycle
events, and the audio relay checks current membership, creator linkage and archive
state before admission. A rejected recent candidate is removed for this plugin
activation when the relay says it is inaccessible or ended; the generic admission
response does not reveal whether it was archived. Incoming lifecycle discovery runs while a conversation header is visible. A green
headphone offers Join for a recent remote Huddle, and clears on end, expiry, or
conversation/community changes. Microphone capture still requires an explicit click.

## Audio settings

The gear beside the compact microphone (before the Leave divider) and the matching
button opposite minimize in the companion open the same Audio settings popover.
Choose a microphone or speakers, or follow the system default. Choices apply to the
current call and update both views; changing the microphone preserves mute. Device
lists refresh when hardware changes and whenever the popover opens. If switching
fails, the previous device remains selected and the popover reports the error.

Capture and playback routing stay in the main window. The companion sends only
call-scoped selection actions. Speaker selection uses WebKit's media-element output
routing; hosts without that API retain system-selected speakers and explain this in
the picker. Leaving releases pending and active device resources. No push-to-talk
or gain controls are included. Physical device switching still needs a native tryout.

## Incoming DM requests

A new Huddle started by another member of a DM appears in both the glass capsule
and the focused Huddle window, even while viewing another conversation. Both show
the caller's avatar and equal-width Join/Decline controls. These use opaque Green 10
and Red 10 fills with inverse labels in both themes; hover uses step 9. They remain
opaque over glass without changing the active-call Leave treatment. The requested
bright-fill/inverse-label pairing has a scoped contrast exception for these incoming
controls; it does not meet every normal text contrast target. The compact label is
“[Name] calling”, with equal padding above, below, and before the avatar. The window's single title
puts “[Name]” on its own line above “is calling”; long names wrap within the window. Channel Huddles keep their existing header and
card join controls without opening an incoming request.

Accepting keeps the caller visible in both surfaces while the connection is prepared,
with Cancel available. Once connected, Motion moves and scales that same avatar
into its final stack/cloud position over 280ms. Each surface has its own layout
group; reduced motion skips the shared movement. Minimizing while accepting keeps
the window minimized after connection, and a renderer reload clears pending requests.

Incoming DM requests ring with `public/sounds/huddle-ping.m4a`, copied from the
user-provided `Pow Sounds/ping.m4a`. One main-window player finishes the clip,
waits one second, then repeats. Both surfaces share it; closing/minimizing the
window leaves the ring active. Joining, declining, request retirement, or disabling
the plugin stops and releases it. If browser autoplay requires interaction, it
waits for that interaction instead of repeatedly retrying playback.

Incoming requests do not capture audio. Join uses the normal audio admission path;
Decline dismisses that room for the current plugin/session lifetime without sending
a relay event or ending the caller's Huddle. Closing/minimizing the request window
leaves its compact prompt available. Requests do not interrupt an active local call.
Ended, expired, inaccessible, self-authored, and pre-activation starts are excluded.
The main renderer clears stale request windows on reload without retiring connected
calls. Request discovery continues from verified live events if its finite read fails.

## Conversation panels and cards

The chat button between microphone and Leave opens a panel beside the avatar
cloud as a flush region with a subtle divider, without separate rounded corners,
shadow or a close button. The same chat button closes it. The shared tabs separate **Thread** from **Live transcript**. Thread uses
the full regular rich-text composer, attachments, emoji, and mentions, with Enter
to send and Shift+Enter for a new line. The detached window sends typed requests
through a per-room capability to the main app, which retains upload preparation,
membership checks, signing, and outbox admission. GIF discovery and search also
run through this owner, using its community and the enabled emoji contribution;
the companion has no direct relay HTTP permission. The tabs stay above the scrolling content. Thread uses
the existing relay session for message history, sending, and failed-message
Retry/Discard. Closing this panel or minimizing the window does not end audio or
cancel an accepted message delivery. Text drafts survive tab changes and reopening. Attachment drafts survive tab changes,
but closing the panel releases its local files. An admitted message clears its persisted
draft in the main app even if the companion closes before acknowledgment. The transcript tab is a placeholder: local speech
generation is deferred and no transcription is recorded by this version.

Both discussion surfaces use the shared message renderer for Markdown and attachments.
The main owner supplies resolved media sources through the native presentation DTO;
images open in the shared image stage without bypassing authenticated media. Native
companion downloads are limited to source/name pairs in its current connected Huddle
presentation, and use the existing bounded download command and safe file destination.

Start/end events appear as cards in the parent conversation. Active cards show
elapsed time beside the same avatar stack as the compact player, and one action:
Join (or Open for your current call) while active, then View after ending. View
opens the saved Huddle conversation in a side panel. Archived rooms remain
read-only. The display is bounded to the latest 200 visible messages (excluding membership and Huddle notices) and says when history
is limited; it does not delete earlier messages.

New rooms carry a parent marker in their relay-owned metadata. Marked rooms stay
out of ordinary sidebar destinations; destinations without metadata are withheld
until they can be classified, preventing temporary unnamed room rows. The discussion reader verifies that
marker before reading or sending. Older trial rooms named `Huddle` or
`huddle-<first eight room-ID characters>` are also hidden when relay-signed metadata
identifies them as private, expiring streams. Names alone never hide a channel.
This only changes presentation: membership and messages remain intact. Unmarked
rooms can open when one of the latest 500 relay-signed join/leave/end events in
the parent identifies that exact room. User-authored cards and room names do not
prove the relationship. This fallback is shared with the detached composer;
current room access and archive state still control reading and writing.
Rooms without that evidence remain unavailable, including sufficiently old calls
outside the bounded lifecycle lookup. The marker and lifecycle
cards use the existing relay protocol; no server changes are part of this slice.

## Ownership and compatibility

- `bundled/huddles` owns the channel launcher, mini player and companion using existing panel
  contributions. It is enabled by default in both the frontend and native catalogs.
- `features/huddle` owns the reusable client controller, bounded Web Audio
  capture/playback, discovery and native adapter. A controller outlives panel
  mounts and is disposed with its plugin activation.
- `src-tauri/src/relay/huddle` owns one native audio connection, identity-bound
  admission, purpose-bound event construction, Opus and socket cleanup. Signing
  stays in the existing IdentityHost. Commands are available only to the main
  application webview.

This is a client-only implementation. It uses the existing private ephemeral
channel creation event (9007, TTL 3600), parent announcement (48100), authenticated
`/huddle/{room}/audio` endpoint and v2 Opus wire format. The relay owns participant
join/leave and last-person teardown. Before an announcement is attempted, a failed
creation is rolled back by archiving its temporary room. After the announcement
may be visible, the client never archives the room on a failed connection: others
may already have joined, so existing relay socket/TTL cleanup owns it.

The macOS bundle includes the microphone purpose string and audio-input entitlement.
Browser-only, Linux and Windows hosts do not expose the launcher in this slice.
Agent voices, transcription generation, screen sharing and automatic reconnect
are outside this first version.

## Checks and tryout

`src/features/huddle/*.test.ts` covers cancellation, scoped session replacement,
plugin disposal, microphone denial and lifecycle discovery. Native Huddle tests
cover wire encoding/decoding, roster handling and command input validation.
`tests/browser/huddles.spec.mjs` exercises the header and mini player in Chromium/WebKit and real
Web Audio capture with Chromium's synthetic microphone. The local fixture is
`/tests/fixtures/huddles.html`; `?audio` requests a local microphone and sends no
audio or events to a relay.

These checks do not prove a live two-person call or packaged OS permission behavior.
The native tryout must verify start/join against another existing Huddle client,
two-way audio, mute, switching conversations, leaving, plugin disable and
community switching. Production audio remains unverified until that live tryout passes. A relay rejection
that audio is unavailable is an operator deployment issue, not microphone permission
failure. Every endpoint that can receive `/huddle/{room}/audio` must support the
relay’s Huddle routing; mixed server pools can make admission intermittent.


### Review follow-up validation

The release signer receives the microphone entitlement explicitly and the returned
signed app is checked for it and its microphone usage description. Linux candidate
build dependencies include system Opus. Actual packaged permission behavior and
Linux candidate runtime loading remain release-environment checks.

Discussion rows retain uncertain delivery separately from rejection. Retry keeps the
original outbox event ID; Discard only removes that local pending record. Recovery
hands keyboard focus to the surviving composer or message log. The detached window
uses the same regular composer and retains focus after Enter-send.

Discovery excludes expired or future starts. Ordinary search, completion, profile,
and exact channel navigation exclude Huddle rooms. Invited requests retire on a
matching relay end. Room invitations expire after 60 seconds. Invited outsiders
cannot receive the private parent's end event, so their prompt may remain until
that deadline; stored metadata does not reflect every automatic archive. Joining
still rechecks current room access on the relay.
