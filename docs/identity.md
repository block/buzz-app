# Packaged human identity and relay access

## Authorize an external agent identity

Settings → Buzz → Security → Authorize external identity accepts an application's
existing public key as 64 hexadecimal characters. An explicit **Authorize
identity** action opens a confirmation showing the exact npub and explaining
that the key can direct the owner's coding agents to run commands as them.
Only **Authorize this key** calls the existing `prepareRemoteAgentAuthorization` host
wrapper and `identity_prepare_remote_agent_authorization` native signer. It
returns a NIP-OA `auth` tag with empty conditions, bound to exactly that agent key
and the current human owner. No key is exported, agent created, membership
changed, or organization session obtained. This proof has no time or event-kind
limits; the form says so before signing. The human copies it to the requesting
application's owner-attestation field.

The form never signs on mount or input changes. It rejects self and malformed
keys, holds the input during signing, checks the returned owner against the
displayed owner, and aborts preparation when settings unmount. Switching owners
remounts an empty form. Proofs stay only in component state until explicitly
copied; input changes clear the prior proof. This section requires a native
desktop identity. A debug build signs as its separate debug identity, not
the installed application's owner. This screen does not expand external-app MCP
scopes or grant remote callers access to signing.

Native macOS, Windows and Linux without the live development broker open on a
welcome screen when no human key exists on this device: **Buzz**, "Your people,
your agents, one place.", with **Sign in with Builderlab**
(the label the Buzz mobile client uses; first-run copy never names the sign-in
provider) and a live **Community URL** field with **Continue** beside it (the
same field and normalisation as Join a community below). Sign in is the one
Builderlab sign-in every Builderlab feature uses, the native NIP-FI session
described next. A failed or canceled sign-in shows *Couldn’t sign in* with the
error and **Back** to the welcome screen. The welcome screen carries the
onboarding artwork and wordmark, and every later first-run page sits on the
same artwork; pages without a finished design are plain black-and-white
wireframes. When a page replaces another, focus moves to the new page's
heading unless the page focuses a field itself, and **Back** returns focus to
the choice that opened the page.

A build's Builderlab is its first sign-in server, the built-in one unless the
build adds another (see
[configuration](configuration.md#federated-identity-build-input)). The bundled
Builderlab plugin has no network or file grant: its Builderlab calls go through
the native FI session (#1461). **Sign in with Builderlab** is the native
[organization sign-in](#native-federated-session-module), whose browser
step, code exchange and token stay native. A session that already exists,
including one saved by an earlier run or adopted from another Buzz copy's
shared sign-in, signs in again, so the browser can choose the account; if that sign-in is canceled, first run stops rather than
continuing as the old account, and one that times out fails as *Sign-in did
not finish*. Setup's account calls then go through the native forwarder as the
bundled plugin's installation, fenced to that session, and a backup hands the
uploader the session's revision. Native admission checks only that
installation's grant, so this works whether or not the plugin has started.
*Checking for a backed-up key* (below) goes through the forwarder too, so
Welcome back offers a restore where the portal accepts the session there. The
session outlives first run: sign-in at launch finds it signed in.

A launch with a key on the device opens the app and never signs in again for
it, however the device was set up. The welcome screen leads with **Sign in**
rather than **Create account** when the Builderlab session is signed in or
needs reauthentication; while the saved session is still restoring, both are
disabled, so a returning user's click never starts a sign-up. With the app open, once that session is signed in
(restored at launch, or signed in later), `LinkedKeyCheck` reads the account's
linked key with the same call Settings → Identity makes, one read per session
revision. A matching key, an account with no key, a refused or absent session
and a failed read change nothing. Another key opens **Your account uses a
different key** over the app, after a second read of the account's backup
status (`backupStatus`). When Builderlab holds a backup of the account's key,
it says that **Replace** removes this computer's key, and either that this
device confirmed a backup of it (as **A different account is saved on this
computer** does) or to copy its private key from Settings → Identity first.
**Replace** runs that dialog's Replace: it signs this key out without erase
and restarts, and the sign-in after the restart takes the lane for a device
with no key, where Welcome back restores the account's key. The restart's note
(`buzz.sign-in-after-restart.v1`) names that key in the same stored item, so a
storage failure can't save the note without it, and an **Open Buzz** that
resumes that sign-in keeps it: when the browser signs in to an
account linked to another key, or to none, setup fails before it
creates, links or restores any key, offering only **Use a different account**,
which drops the expectation, as **Create account** does: a new account can't
be the one Replace restarted for. With no backup of
the account's key, or no backups on this build or account (`unavailable`),
Replace is not offered, since Welcome back could not restore it: the dialog says the account's
key lives on another device and offers only **OK**. A backup status read that
fails asks nothing, since whether a backup exists is unknown; the next session
revision reads again. **Not now**, **OK** and
Close keep the key and are remembered for that pair of keys (the account's and
this device's) and whether Replace was offered (`buzz.linked-key-dismissed.v1`),
so it asks again only when either key changes or the account's key gets a
backup. The prompt waits while the launch screen shows or old Buzz's
communities are being offered or added. The backup consent prompt stays
mounted but waits while it shows, so a consent prompt closed earlier stays
closed after it.

A URL given on the welcome screen is looked up first, before sign-in and before
any key exists: **Continue** opens the same **Finding community** page described
below, which sends only the two unauthenticated GETs, so a typo, an unreachable
relay or a non-Buzz address fails there with the same classified copy; **Cancel**
(and **Retry**, when offered) behave as below, except that Cancel returns to the
welcome screen with the address kept in the field. A build has one Builderlab,
its first sign-in server, and a community is hosted by it when that server's
`communityHosts` cover the community's host (`builderlab-hosted.ts`). The front
end reads native's compiled server list and matches with native's own rules
(`community-hosts.ts`, kept equal to `matches_relay` by shared fixtures): an
exact host, or one label under a wildcard on the default port. A relay's NIP-11
`self` key never decides. A build without a sign-in server (FI set empty,
another or an empty `BUZZ_BUILDERLAB_URL`, or `tauri dev` with the development
broker pinned) has no first-run Builderlab sign-in, so it hosts none, whatever
its Builderlab URL. In live development the Builderlab plugin still signs in
through the development broker (unless `BUZZ_BUILDERLAB_URL` is empty), but
first run never uses that sign-in. The answer applies only to the lookup that
asked: Cancel, another address or leaving the screen discards it. Such a
community requires Builderlab sign-in, so it starts at once there, exactly as
the welcome screen's own button does, and the welcome screen shows it pending
(**Cancel sign-in**, with the field disabled); setup then lands on **Join
Community** for the address, and it is never offered a key of the user's own
instead. Cancel sign-in, **Back** from a sign-in failure, and **Use a
different account** from a setup failure, return to the welcome screen with the address kept and do not look it up again. A
canceled sign-in that finishes later is ignored: it cannot restart setup or use
a later sign-in's account. Any other found community, including one run by
another Builderlab deployment, pauses on **Connect to {host}**: nothing a relay publishes names its sign-in portal, so the user
chooses. The page says only that Buzz relies on a key for the user's identity; its choices are
**Sign in with Builderlab**, which signs in at `BUZZ_BUILDERLAB_URL` and
continues exactly as the welcome screen's own button does (the landing shows
the sign-in pending with the address held; the key it creates is linked to that
account and backed up there), and setup then lands on **Join Community** for
the address;
**I already have a key** opens **Enter your private key** and, with no account
signed in, continues from there with no link step and no backup offer (once the
app opens, the key's backup choice is
[filled in like any missing one](#automatic-backup-consent-hooks)); **Back**
returns to the welcome screen with the address kept. A build without a sign-in
server skips that page: with no first-run Builderlab sign-in to offer, every
found community opens **Enter your private key**, whose **Back** returns to the
welcome screen with the address kept.

Success continues to **Getting ready**, with an animated bee. Detailed operation
status remains available to screen readers without a visible second line. It first runs **Checking your account**, a real read of the
Nostr key bound to the signed-in Builderlab account
(`POST /api/goose/v1/buzz/nostr-identities/current` at the portal that signed
the user in, sent through the native forwarder with the NIP-FI session as the
bundled plugin's installation; `src/features/identity/builderlab-account.ts`,
sharing the hosted-communities card's routes and reply parsers). A `200` with
no `identity` means no key is linked (kgoose sends `MISSING_MAPPING` only from
the community list); any other failure is **Couldn’t finish setup**, naming the
step and HTTP status (never the response body), for example "Builderlab account
check failed (HTTP 403: not JSON)". A lapsed sign-in, which kgoose answers on
every account route with a plain-text HTTP 401, reads *Your Builderlab sign-in
is no longer valid.* here and on every later account step. Binding is 1:1 and
enforced, so the answer picks the lane: a linked account is never given a
second key. Under the same label, and in parallel, it reads the destinations
saved to the account (`POST /api/goose/v1/buzz/known-communities/list`, same
portal and credential: the list the Builderlab plugin's
[known-communities sync](communities.md#known-communities) keeps, which needs
no Nostr identity). That read never fails setup: a refusal, a portal without
the route (a plain-text `404`) or a row the app cannot read leaves the list
unknown and first run continues as if the account had saved none. The list is
kept from sign-in until the welcome screen is shown again, so Start over keeps
it, and every lane ends by restoring it (*Restoring your communities*, below).

Either lane continues with *Checking for a backed-up key*, which reads the
keys the account holds a backup of
(`POST /api/goose/v1/buzz/nsec-backups/status`, same portal). It is sent only
where the backup step can run (see
[automatic backup](#automatic-backup-and-optional-recovery)); kgoose answers
`404` wherever backups are not configured. Not sent, a `404` or any failure
leaves the lookup unavailable rather than empty, and never fails setup: it only
decides whether Welcome back offers a restore and whether an import needs
automatic backup. A lookup that fails, unlike one that isn't configured, still
lets Welcome back offer the restore: a backup may hold the key, and the restore
page says when none does and offers **Enter my private key**.

**Not linked** pauses on **Get started with Buzz**, which says the account will
manage the Buzz identity. **Set me up** creates and links a key; **Use an
existing key** opens **Enter your private key**. **Use a different account**
signs out the shared native session first run signed in as, so the Builderlab
plugin stops using it, and returns to the welcome screen. It leaves a newer
session (from Settings or another copy) signed in, and a failed sign-out shows
on the welcome screen. Cancel and Back do not sign out. Until a sign-in
completes, every sign-in from there asks the browser for credentials rather
than continuing as the account it remembers. This choice page shows the
signed-in email so the account can be checked before linking a key.

Builderlab setup automatically backs up the created key after linking it to the
signed-in account and waits for the uploader. The import screen discloses
this behavior. A failed backup stays in setup with **Try again**, preserving the
key on this device; it cannot be bypassed by disabling backup. If the session
has expired, retry signs in again and must return to the original account before
uploading. A canceled sign-in or different account leaves setup and the key intact. First run never
reveals a newly created key; Settings → Identity can reveal it later.

**Enter your private key** accepts a plain-text `nsec1…` key or a text file up to 1 KiB.
The input stays masked until **Reveal private key** is selected using the eye
inside the field; **Hide private key** masks it again. The public identity preview uses npub. NIP-49 encrypted backups are not supported;
invalid input stays on the form. **I lost my key** sits under the input. **Back**
discards the draft. A successful account-backed import links the key and automatically backs it up
unless that key already has a backup. An import without Builderlab
sign-in skips linking and backup. Importing without a Builderlab account never uploads the key.

**Another account's key on this device** (a sign-in as someone else with a key
already here) is never replaced without asking: **A different account is saved on this
computer** asks first. **Replace** signs it out, as **Sign out of Buzz** does
without erase; Buzz restarts and signs in again by itself (a one-time note
honoured for two minutes), now on the lane for a device with no key. **Cancel**
signs out of the new account and returns to the welcome screen with the
device's key in place. When this device has confirmed a stored backup of the key
(`nsec_backup_confirmed`: a backup record here, under any account, that the
service receipted or a restore wrote), the question says the key is backed up
in Builderlab and that signing in to its account again restores it; otherwise
it says the key may not be backed up and shows the same private-key controls
as Settings' **Remove from device**, with its gate: **Replace** stays disabled
until the key was revealed or copied and **I have my key** is checked. Each new
question starts unchecked. A local receipt is not consent, and the backup may since
have been deleted, so a confirmed backup only changes the wording and drops that
wait. Creating or importing a key still refuses while one is on the device.

An account with no key takes this device's key, else old Buzz's, else a new
one, without asking. When the account holds no key, the account check can't
tell whose this device's key is, but the link can: kgoose refusing it as
another account's (`pubkey_already_bound`) makes it another account's key on
this device, handled as above rather than failing setup. Finding the account
linked to another key meanwhile (`identity_already_bound`, a race with another
device) leaves this device's key not the account's, which the account check
also asks about with the same dialog; after Replace, the next sign-in finds the
account's key. Old Buzz's key is
linked before it is saved: native signs the link challenge with it straight
from old Buzz's storage (`identity_sign_builderlab_binding` with `legacy`,
only while no key is saved here, and saving nothing), and first run saves it
only once the account holds it, from that same read (native holds the key in
memory between the signature and the save, so the OS asks for old Buzz's
storage once). When kgoose refuses it as another account's, or it can't be
read (absent, a denied OS prompt or malformed, which native answers with
null), first run makes a new key instead, so a key that can't be linked never
reaches this device. Any other failure, such as a challenge that expired before
native signed it or a busy or locked store, fails setup with Try again, which
links old Buzz's key again. A run that linked it and then stopped before the
save (a failed save, or Buzz quit in between) leaves the account holding a key
this device lacks. First run notes on this device that it is linking old
Buzz's key (`buzz.legacy-link-pending.v1`) until the key is saved or was never
linked. Only with that note, when the account's key isn't backed up, the next
sign-in checks old Buzz's key before resting on Welcome back
(`identity_import_legacy` with `expected`, which saves it only when it is the
account's key and otherwise saves nothing, and clears the note), then saves
and backs it up and continues as a returning account would. Without the note,
no other sign-in brings up the OS prompt for old Buzz's storage.

**Linked** pauses on **Welcome back**: the account is already linked to a Buzz
identity — the key on the user's other device — shown as the full npub under
*Linked public key (npub)* with **Copy**, with the same *Signed in as {email}.*
line under the body. When the linked key isn't the one on this device, the page
says so: *Your account’s key isn’t on this device*, then to try a restore from a
backup or enter its private key or, with no restore offered, to enter its private key.
With a restore offered, an **Enter your private key** row under the key row
opens the import page without waiting on the restore. A linked key does not mean a
backed-up one, so only when the lookup lists the linked key, or failed, does the page also
offer **Restore from backup** (primary), with **Enter your private key** as a
smaller choice; otherwise **Enter your private key** is primary. It opens the
same import page, which here accepts only the linked key: any other valid nsec
is refused under the field with *That isn’t the key linked to this account. It
expects npub1…*, and **Back** returns to Welcome back. **Recover from another
device** is *Coming soon* (device pairing is its future entry). Last in the
stack, **Use a different account** is the same exit as on Get started with Buzz: it
signs the session out and returns to the welcome screen, where the next
sign-in asks for credentials, without importing, restoring or replacing the
linked key. The imported
key is already the account's, so nothing is linked. Unless the lookup already
lists it, a successful import automatically backs up the key as on a new
account; a listed key continues without another upload.

**Restore your key** opens native recovery in a separate browser sign-in.
Only the account’s linked key can be installed. While waiting, **Cancel** cancels
the attempt; during installation, navigation is disabled. A successful install
continues directly to community restoration and the next required step, without
another Welcome back confirmation. One status screen shows **Restoring your key…**
throughout recovery, with a browser sign-in hint while waiting. Failure shows **Couldn’t restore your key**,
with **Enter my private key**, **I lost my key**, optional **Try again**, then Back.
Retry is available for transient errors and partially retrieved backups, but not
for unavailable/refused recovery, a complete empty result or complete mismatch.
The error names its cause where native knows it: a browser sign-in the user
declined (`error=access_denied`) is **Restore was canceled**, a browser step that
timed out says so, and no answer from Builderlab (network, DNS, TLS) is
**Couldn't reach Builderlab**. Other failures keep **Could not restore your
identity**.
Leaving or retrying cancels the native attempt first. Nothing claims the key is
saved before installation succeeds.

**I lost my key** opens **Lost your key?**, which first suggests checking another
signed-in device or a usable backup. Starting over replaces the linked key;
old messages and profiles are not deleted, but access does not carry over.
A warning says the old key can never be linked again: kgoose revokes an
unlinked key, and binding it later fails.
Owned community hostnames appear only when present; a failed lookup still shows
its error. **Go back** returns to the prior screen. **Start over with a new key**
creates a key, unlinks the old key, links the new one, then automatically backs it up.
The old key stays linked until the new one is on the device,
and binding never overwrites, so the unlink comes after creation and before
the link. The unlink checks the bound key first: it sends nothing more when
the account holds no key or the new one, fails when it holds a third key, and
deletes only while it is still the old one, so repeating it never removes the
new key's binding. It
counts as done only when kgoose confirms removing the old key, or the account
then holds no key or the new one. If the old key is still bound (kgoose removes
nothing when the sign-in is no longer active) or another key is, the step fails
without Try again.
Welcome back itself never offers Set me up.

Every lane ends the same way. A linked account runs **Finding communities**
(the same real read) once its key is on the device; the old key's list is not
read after starting over. A failed step shows **Couldn’t finish setup** with the
error — for a refused link, the hosted-communities card's copy (*This
Builderlab account is connected to another Buzz identity.*, *This Buzz identity
is connected to another Builderlab account.*) or first run's own for kgoose's
other refusals, such as an expired link request or too many attempts; for a
backup, why it did not complete; otherwise the step and HTTP status, as for the
account check. kgoose's own wording is never shown, nor its correlation ID,
which stays on the error and is logged in development builds. Once a key is on
the device, the page also says what is undone: *Your key is saved on this
device, but it isn’t linked to your account or backed up yet.* when
the unlink or link failed (a key that isn't linked can't be backed up),
otherwise *Your key is saved on this device.* **Try again** repeats the failed step and the rest of the
lane without creating another key. It is offered only where another attempt
can help: an ended Builderlab sign-in (HTTP 401, `retryable: false`), where
signing in again helps instead, or a backup failure the failure table marks not
retryable, leaves only the way out. Other refusals keep Try again: after Start
over it is the only way past a failed unlink. An expired backup session prompts sign-in
again and verifies the original account subject before uploading. Canceled or
wrong-account sign-in leaves setup and the key intact. When backup is explicitly unavailable in the build or not offered by the
account, **Continue without backup** skips only that backup step and runs the
remaining community setup. It retains the saved linked key and does not persist
a backup opt-out. Transient backup failures remain retry-only; linking cannot
be bypassed.
After a Builderlab sign-in, the page offers **Use a different account** in
place of Back: it signs out of the account and returns to the welcome screen,
keeping any key here. Back alone would sign in to the same account again from
the browser's session. With a key here, that screen offers **Sign in**, which
asks for credentials and checks the key with the next account, and **Continue
without signing in**, which opens the app with that key. This is the only way a
key on the device reaches the welcome screen, and nothing about it is saved:
the next launch opens the app. A link kgoose refuses because the key or the account is already
bound elsewhere (`pubkey_already_bound`, `identity_already_bound`) is not
offered Try again, which would get the same answer; Use a different account is
the only way on. Failures before any sign-in keep **Back**.

Within one first-run session the Join page exits only through a join or a
restored community; there is no skip. That holds only while the app stays
open. Quitting with a key on the device but no saved community ends first run:
the next launch restores the key and, with setup idle, lifts the gate straight
into the in-app **Join a community** landing (`CommunityLanding`), the page a
key without a community has always opened on. The key stays on the device, and
the ID card in Settings → Identity shows the backup state. A
link or backup step still running at quit ends with the process: the native
uploader's pass is retired, and whether the link committed on kgoose is unknown
to the client. Both are safe to run again — the link reads the account's current
key first and does nothing when it already holds this one, and the uploader runs
again when the user next signs in to Builderlab in Settings — but nothing
re-runs the link on its own, and Settings has no row for it; the Identity
card reports what the uploader's last pass found. Below it, a **Backed-up key · Linked**
row appears only when the account's linked key differs from this device's and
`nsec-backups/status` (read with the bundled Builderlab session as first run reads
it) lists it. The same-key summary and community activity lookup are omitted.
For a key without a confirmed backup, account lookup failures share the card's
**Backup status unknown** caption and **Retry backup** action; a confirmed key
stays **Backed up**. Retry refreshes the account lookup as well as starting
the native backup attempt. Backups of other keys are left out and the row is
read-only: making another key the account's would unlink the current one, and
kgoose never links a key again once it is unlinked.

In Builderlab → Communities, a mismatched account offers **Switch to this
device’s identity** only behind a confirmation that the account's current key
will be permanently unlinked, and that this device's key is refused too if it
was unlinked before (as after Start over on another device), leaving the
account with no key. The client can't detect that revocation, so the mismatch
copy also points to the safe path: sign in on this device with the account's
key. There is no Unpair action.

Every lane ends with *Restoring your communities…* when the account check
listed destinations saved to the account (`src/features/identity/restore-communities.ts`):
each distinct destination this build can open (the list is deduplicated by
canonical origin, and an address the app cannot open is skipped) gets the
same signed profile read the Join Community page uses to prove admission, at
most three at once, and none started more than 45 s after the step began. A
destination that admits the key is saved to this device through
`communities.joined` under its hostname (its relay profile seeds the empty
local default); one that refuses the key, cannot be reached or will not save
is recorded and otherwise silent — nothing shows it in the app, and the
Builderlab plugin's sync adds it without an admission read after the next
Settings sign-in. The step never fails setup. Where setup rests then depends
on what was admitted:

- Nothing (the list was empty, unreadable, or every destination was refused or
  unreachable): the Join page below, as if the account had saved none.
- At least one, with no address given on the welcome screen: the first
  admitted is selected and the app opens on it.
- At least one, and the welcome-screen address is among them: that one is
  selected and the app opens on it; nothing else is asked.
- At least one, but the welcome-screen address is not among them (not saved,
  refused or unreachable): the first admitted is selected, the app opens on it,
  and the typed address — with its invite code, if it came from an invite link —
  is handed to the rail's **Add a community** dialog through the same invite
  intent a `buzz://join` link uses ([deep links](deep-links.md)), so the join
  completes inside the app: discovery, policy, code, profile. A saved
  destination that refused the key therefore never shows the first-run **This
  community needs an invite** page; the dialog's access step says to ask an
  administrator for a code, and the npub is in Settings → Identity. Closing
  the dialog leaves the restored community selected.

Entering the app this way (as after a first-run join) first runs the profile
step below when no profile exists anywhere, and clears the typed address from
the welcome screen's own state, so once the dialog owns it nothing on this
side can look it up again. The startup visit's 15-second deadline runs only
while the app is presenting it, so a first run of any length enters on the
channels page rather than a timed-out destination. Otherwise setup lands on
**Join Community** for the address given on the welcome screen, looked up again
(the policy may have changed meanwhile), or otherwise on **Join a community**,
laid out as the in-app Join a community landing: a centred heading, then, when
the account owns communities, rows under *Communities you own* — icon
placeholder, hostname and **Join** (named *Join {host}* for assistive
technology), which takes exactly the typed-URL path for that host — then a
**Community URL** field with **Continue** beside it. An empty or failed list
shows the page without rows. No invite list is shown; nothing serves pending
invites yet. In development,
[`BUZZ_DEV_FIRST_RUN_ACCOUNT`](configuration.md#first-run-account-seed-development)
answers the two account reads, and fakes the link, the unlink and the backup,
in place of kgoose and the native uploader.

The URL field is live. A typed address may omit its scheme (`relay.example.com`
is read as `wss://relay.example.com`); `wss://` and `https://` are accepted in
any case, while `ws://`/`http://`, credentials, paths, queries and fragments are
not (`enteredRelayOrigin` in `src/features/communities/destination.ts`).
**Continue** stays enabled while the field is empty or invalid; Continue or
Enter submits, and an empty or invalid address shows *Please enter a valid
community URL* under the field. Continue only starts the lookup; the join itself
is the Join Community page's **Join**. The field also takes an invite link: the
relay's `https://<host>/invite/<code>` page, or the `buzz://join?relay=…&code=…`
link that page opens (`parsePastedInvite` in
`src/features/communities/invite-link.ts`). The community is looked up at the
link's origin exactly as for a typed address, and nothing is sent with the code
until Join claims it; a link given on the welcome screen keeps its code through
sign-in and setup.

Join opens **Finding community** (`src/features/communities/FindCommunity.tsx`,
reusable by later flows): the hostname and **Cancel** at once, with a "Looking
up {host}…" status only after one second (the shared `LoadingRegion`, as for
any initial read; Retry starts the second again). **Cancel** returns to Join a
community with the typed address intact — however the user arrived there — and
discards any late answer. The page reads the relay's NIP-11
document and `/api/join-policy` in parallel through the identity-free native
`relay_http` GET path. Those two unauthenticated GETs are the only pre-join
traffic: nothing is signed with the device's key until the user chooses to join.
On success it shows **Join Community**: only what the relay publishes — the
icon if set and the hostname — plus, when the deployment has a join policy,
*I confirm that I am at least 18 years old.* (if age attestation is required) and
*I agree to this community’s Terms of Service and Privacy Notice.*, whose links
open the relay's `/api/join-policy/terms` and `/privacy` pages outside the app. No
name, description, member count, owner or invite badge is shown: none is knowable
before joining. **Join** sits to the right of **Cancel**, as in every dialog
footer, and is always labelled Join: shown consent boxes gate it, they do not
rename it. A signed-in Builderlab account's consent covers a community its
server hosts (`accountConsents` in `src/features/communities/account-consent.ts`:
the session's `communityHosts`, matched as native matches them). Account setup
records a date of birth, which kgoose refuses for anyone under 18, and agrees to
the Buzz Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that Builderlab-hosted relays
publish as their policy. Such a community shows no boxes, and its Join attests
both, so an invite claim confirms the person's age. Its **Continue** from Join a
community, or a listed owned community, joins at once without Join Community, as
a just-created community does, unless it comes back from a failed join. The
in-app dialog likewise skips its access step for such a community when no code
is needed or one was given. An imported key with no account, and a community no
signed-in server hosts, still ask. Lookup failures are classified, not echoed: an unreachable relay or an
unusable policy answer offers **Cancel** and **Retry** (a missing policy counts as
"none" only once NIP-11 confirmed a Buzz relay); a non-Buzz address or a Buzz
relay with no community bound to that host offers **Cancel** only.

**Join** is the same join the rail's Add-a-community dialog performs, through
the same owner (`admitCommunity` and `completeJoin` in
`src/features/communities/join.ts`, which save through `communities.joined` in
`src/features/communities/service.ts`; [communities](communities.md)). Before
anything is sent, the join is recorded on this device for the key (the join
journal, `join-journal.ts`), so a reply lost between the relay and the app —
a claim the relay honoured but the app never heard — is not claimed again: a
later Join for a recorded community first sends the signed profile read, and
only when that still denies the key does it claim. A device that cannot keep
the record stops there with the journal's storage message and sends nothing.
When the address came with an invite code, Join
claims it as the dialog does: if the deployment has a join policy, the
policy is accepted for that code with its version and the age box
(`/api/invites/accept-policy`), then the claim (`/api/invites/claim`) carries the
returned receipt; both are NIP-98-signed by the key, and the relay must answer
that the key joined or already was a member. Then, with or without a code, a
signed profile read (`inspectProfile`: NIP-11 again, then a NIP-98-signed
`POST /query` for the key's own kind 0) proves the relay admits this key. The
membership — the canonical origin as id, the hostname as name, the NIP-11
icon if set — is saved to this device and selected, and the gate lifts into the
app on that community; when **Set up your profile** follows (below), the
membership is saved after that step, as in the dialog, so nothing is joined
while it stands. After a Builderlab sign-in the destination is also saved
to the account straight away (`POST /api/goose/v1/buzz/known-communities/add`
with its `wss://host[:port]` address, same portal and credential as the account
reads), so the user's other devices restore it; the app waits for that answer,
but a failed save never stops it opening. A key imported from **Connect to
{host}** has no account, so nothing is saved there. Restored destinations are
not saved again, and joins in the in-app dialog reach the account through the
sync instead ([known communities](communities.md#known-communities)). While the
join is in flight the page shows *Joining…* with Join and Cancel disabled. The
join itself publishes nothing: no kind 0, and no policy receipt or invite claim
without a code. Without a code the ticked boxes are the client's record of
consent, as on the dialog's code-less path.

A relay that requires an invite answers the read with 401/403, shown as **This
community needs an invite**; a claim the relay refuses (an expired, used-up or
invalid code, or a policy that changed) lands on the same page with the dialog's
refusal copy under the code field, and no read is sent. The page offers an
**Invite code** field with **Join**, which runs the same policy acceptance (under
the consent the first Join gave), claim and read for the typed code; a refusal
shows under the field and keeps the page and the typed code, and a code the
native route will not send (anything but letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`)
reads as not valid. Admins also admit people by npub, so the page shows the
user's public key as the full npub (never hex or an abbreviation) under *Your
public key (npub)* with **Copy** and an inline copied/could-not-copy status,
plus the note that it is their public identity and safe to share. **Try again**
repeats the join without a code, so an admin's add takes effect without
retyping the address; **Back** returns to the find page (the typed address
stays in the URL field behind it). A relay that cannot be reached — for the
claim or the read — shows the lookup's unreachable copy; a device that will
not keep the join's record shows the journal's storage message. Both offer
**Back**. An existing relay profile seeds the empty local default.

When the admitted relay profile has no trimmed nonempty name, the gate stays up
for **Set up your profile** (`src/features/identity/ProfileStep.tsx`). The shared
fields show an optional avatar and required name, suggested from the Builderlab
email when there is no existing relay profile. The same prompt follows community
restoration when the selected relay profile has no name. A named relay profile
skips it. Restored memberships are already saved: this prompt is not a persistent
relaunch gate for those existing memberships. **Continue** uses the dialog's
profile completion (`completeJoin`): the draft is
recorded in the join journal, the profile is read afresh, the kind 0 is
published to that one relay through the same signed `relay_sign` +
`POST /events` route Settings → Profile uses when the draft differs from what
the relay holds, and it is read back; only a readback that is current saves the
membership (and the result as the device's local default for later joins) and
enters the app on the community. A rejected publish, or a readback the relay
has since superseded, stays on the step with the error inline and the draft
intact. **Go back** returns to community selection without completing the join.
A trimmed nonempty name is required; the avatar is optional. Settings → Profile
remains the editor. Denied/unavailable/corrupt storage is not first run: like the page
shown while the saved identity opens, it is titled **Your Buzz identity**, and
it keeps the **Retry secure storage access** path. A saved key native can't
parse (`MALFORMED`) gets the same bytes on every read, so that page offers
**Remove from device** instead of a retry. It confirms first, then signs out as
**Sign out of Buzz** does without erase: the next launch deletes the key and
opens first run, which restores the account's backup or imports a key. A
refused sign-out stays in the dialog with its reason. On Windows and Linux,
several keyring items matching one entry (`Ambiguous`) refuse deletes as well
as reads, so native answers `AMBIGUOUS` instead, and the page keeps **Retry**:
the user removes the extra items with their keyring app.

The key setup screen (`IdentitySetup`) is no longer shown on first launch; the
fixture below still renders it. It offers **Create a new identity** or **Use an
existing key**. These are alternatives. It can also offer **Continue with your
Buzz identity** when old Buzz is installed and **Restore from backup** in builds
with backup recovery configured; both are described below. Import accepts an
nsec, validates its checksum and secp256k1 scalar, and persists that exact key
before adopting its public identity. It never generates a replacement after an
import, read or write failure.

One native owner keeps the key in memory after successful restore. The new
create-only secure-storage item is service `xyz.block.buzz.desktop.identity` in release
builds, or `xyz.block.buzz.desktop.identity.debug` with Rust debug assertions,
account `human`. Debug worktrees share the debug item, not the release identity;
ports and frontend dev mode do not isolate it. `just desktop me` is the one
exception: it signs in with the release key, read from
`xyz.block.buzz.desktop.identity` (else its pre-1.0 service), and never copies,
replaces or deletes it. Create, import and Sign out still use only the debug item,
so Sign out ends the session but the next launch reads the release key again. A
denied or broken read of the release key is an error, never a fallback; only
an absent one falls back to the debug item. Only the `me` argument sets
`BUZZ_DEV_RELEASE_KEY`: the launcher drops it from `.env.local` and the shell,
since bootstrap copies `.env.local` into agent worktrees, and refuses `me`
anywhere but first. On macOS the release
item trusts only the release app; `me` reads it through the
[local credential helper](#local-credential-helper-on-macos), so Keychain asks
once rather than after each rebuild. macOS keeps its existing default
file Keychain/security-framework implementation. Windows uses Credential Manager;
Linux uses Secret Service through keyring 3.6.3, as old Buzz does. Linux requires
a running desktop Secret Service with a default collection (for example GNOME
Keyring), reachable on the user's session D-Bus. Missing, inaccessible or ambiguous
storage fails closed: unlock/configure the store and explicitly retry.

Human storage does not use or change agent credentials or old Buzz's
`buzz-desktop/secrets` blob. A competing item refuses overwrite. Windows/Linux
creates and agent deletes share a per-user, service/account file lock under the
OS account's home `.buzz-foundation/credential-locks`, independent of HOME/XDG,
profile and worktree overrides. Lock files are empty, retained, and never hold keys;
a busy lock reports a retryable error rather than waiting behind another process's
consent dialog. Locks serialize cooperating Buzz instances, not arbitrary other
programs or other machines. Windows credentials use keyring's enterprise persistence
and may roam under Windows policy; locks do not coordinate machines.
Neither Windows Credential Manager nor Secret Service supplies per-app access
isolation from other programs running as the same OS user.

There is no file/environment fallback, automatic legacy migration or human key
replacement. When installed old Buzz's data folder (`xyz.block.buzz.app`) exists,
the welcome screen opens a **Continue with your Buzz identity?** dialog over
itself. The landing's actions never wait for the folder check, and the dialog
waits while a sign-in is pending or another first-run page shows. Only its
**Continue** reads old Buzz's `buzz-desktop`/`secrets` item, so any OS access
prompt follows that click; the offer itself checks only the folder. It takes
the item's `identity` entry and saves it exactly as a pasted import would:
validated, create-only, never over a saved key, and never writing the old item.
A failed import shows its error in the dialog, where Continue tries again. Success enters the app with no Builderlab sign-in, link
or backup choice (one is [filled in](#automatic-backup-consent-hooks) once
Builderlab is signed in), where that key's old communities are offered
([Import from the previous desktop app](communities.md#import-from-the-previous-desktop-app)).
**Not now** or Escape leaves the welcome screen as it was, with focus on its
heading, and the dialog stays closed until the app next starts with no key. It
returns after Sign out while old Buzz's data remains. The human key is deleted
from this device only by [Sign out of Buzz](#sign-out-of-buzz); no other command
or plugin service can delete it. Agents' bring-over (`app_agent_port`) may read
only the selected old Buzz service/account and copy the selected agent key into
this app's separate agent namespace; it never writes the old blob.
No user key belongs in release configuration.

## Local credential helper on macOS

Keychain approvals belong to the program that asks, and a debug build is a
different program after every rebuild, so without help Keychain asks again for
every saved item after each rebuild. On macOS, `just desktop me` avoids this with
a helper: a small program, `crates/dev-credential-helper`, that does the debug
build's Keychain reads and writes. It is installed once outside the repository
and kept, so an approval given to it lasts across rebuilds and worktrees.

Only `me` turns it on. Before launching, it:

1. installs the helper for this checkout's protocol as
   `~/.buzz-foundation/dev-credential-helper/buzz-dev-credential-helper-v<protocol>`
   if none is there or it does not report that `--version` protocol. Otherwise it
   keeps the installed one, even if this worktree's source differs, since a new
   helper needs every item approved again. Each protocol has its own helper, so
   switching between worktrees on different protocols replaces neither; a new
   protocol's helper needs every item approved once;
2. creates a self-signed code-signing certificate, **Buzz Dev Signing**, in the
   login Keychain if there is none, and records the code requirement
   `identifier "xyz.block.buzz.desktop.dev" and certificate leaf = H"…"` beside the
   helper;
3. starts the debug build through `scripts/dev-sign-run.sh`, a Cargo runner that
   signs it with that certificate, and sets `BUZZ_DEV_CREDENTIAL_HELPER` to the
   helper and `BUZZ_DEV_CREDENTIAL_HELPER_AUTHORIZE=1`.

If any step fails, it warns and launches without the helper. As with
`BUZZ_DEV_RELEASE_KEY`, the launcher drops these variables from `.env.local` and
the shell, so agent worktrees and plain `just desktop` never use the helper.

On the first launch, click **Always Allow** on each dialog: one for `codesign` to
use the new certificate, then one per saved item. Later launches, rebuilds and new
worktrees show none. Each helper request first runs with Keychain dialogs off;
only an item not yet approved for the helper, under `--authorize`, is retried once
with a dialog. A denied dialog is an error. Release builds ignore the helper.

With `BUZZ_DEV_CREDENTIAL_HELPER` set (an absolute path) in a macOS debug build,
every `buzz-credential-store` read, add, replace and delete goes through it: the
human key, including the release key `me` reads, agents, federated sessions, the
Jev and Claude keys, paired tools and external-app pairings. Bringing over old
Buzz's items still reads them directly, since that happens once. A helper failure is
returned as is; the app never retries through direct Keychain access, and keeps
its own locks, create-only rules, validation and read-back checks. The app passes
`[--authorize] --item <read|add|replace|delete> <service> <account>`, with a fresh
Unix socket as stdout and no stdin. For `add` and `replace` it sends the value and
closes its write side; for `read` the helper returns the exact item bytes. Each
direction has a 2 MiB limit. Exit 0 is success, 10 absent, 11 denied, 12 corrupt
and 13 occupied; other failures are unavailable. Requests time out after five
seconds, or two minutes under `BUZZ_DEV_CREDENTIAL_HELPER_AUTHORIZE=1`.

The helper serves only an exact list of items and refuses any other service or
account. It may only read the release key, never write, copy over or delete it, and
it never replaces the debug human key, which stays create-only. Before it reads a
value or touches the Keychain, it checks that stdout is a Unix socket whose peer is
its parent process, by audit token, and that the peer's live code signature meets
the recorded requirement. The requirement file must belong to the user and be
writable by no one else. It uses the default Keychain, updates items in place so
they keep their access lists, and confirms that a deleted item is gone. It logs
nothing.

The helper's source is in the repository. Its installed binary, the requirement,
the certificate and its private key stay on each Mac, never in the repository.
The certificate check trusts access to its signing key: any program running as you
that can sign code with that key and identifier passes it, and the key lets
`codesign` use it without asking. On that Mac, approving the helper's items
therefore extends trust to those programs. Don't use `me` on a shared account.

## Automatic backup and optional recovery

Desktop builds configured with `BUZZ_NSEC_BACKUP_SERVICE_URL` and
`BUZZ_NSEC_BACKUP_NAMESPACE` back up a local identity only after an explicit saved
automatic-backup choice, Builderlab login, and matching key
binding. Unset, self-managed, corrupt or mismatched consent prevents all backup
requests, including retries; a key with no saved choice waits for the app to
[fill one in](#automatic-backup-consent-hooks). An organization-managed build
also sets `BUZZ_NSEC_BACKUP_CONSENT=managed`: backup then needs no saved choice
and ignores one, so every local key is backed up, including one created before
backup was configured. The service and namespace are paired
native build-process inputs; unset or empty leaves the feature disabled. Preview
releases that sign in to `app.builderlab.xyz` set them to that origin's
`/api/goose` service and the `backup/bb-public/production` namespace. The service URL
includes its API prefix and must use HTTPS. Backup uses the NIP-FI session only
when the service is the build's Builderlab, at its identity origin and API base
path. Without a current session, backup defers without opening a browser or
delaying identity readiness. Recovery keeps its own browser sign-in (below).

The native host validates enrollment and seals with the reviewed HPKE v1 protocol.
Only encrypted pending bytes and public completion metadata are saved in the OS
account's `.buzz-foundation/nsec-backups/<human credential service>` folder, scoped
separately for debug and release. A shared lock serializes cooperating
copies. Pending bytes and IDs survive restart; later login/binding/key-install
events retry them, including a coalesced follow-up when an event arrives during an
active pass. Upload success requires a matching stored receipt. Backup
failure never replaces or deletes the local identity.

The main WebView can observe the uploader through `identity.backup`, which
registers on first read and stays out of identity snapshots. Its status says
whether Builderlab backup can run in this build and whether the latest pass is
idle, running, complete, waiting for consent, a session or a key binding, or
failed with a named kind; no service response body reaches the renderer. A login
handoff or retry resolves to the number of the pass it starts, or to none, so a
caller can wait for that pass's own outcome. A pass superseded by a key install
reports nothing; reloading the window mid-pass or during a wait for consent
reports idle. Handing the session back ends a running pass or a wait for
consent as waiting for a session.

First run's **Backing up your key** is a pass of this uploader. It saves the
automatic choice for the key, hands the first-run Builderlab sign-in to the
uploader, waits up to 60 seconds for the pass that handoff starts, and then
hands the sign-in back, whatever the outcome; an earlier pass's result never
answers it. The sign-in is the NIP-FI session the Builderlab plugin
also hands the uploader, so after a completed backup it stays with the
uploader, which runs one more pass; after a failure the uploader has no session
until the plugin hands it over again, when that session changes or the app
restarts. A pass that stops to wait for consent, a session or a key binding
fails the step, since nothing would wake it again before first run ends. The
failed page names the reason without any service response. The automatic choice
stays on after a failure, so a later
Builderlab sign-in may still finish the backup the user asked for. The step
hands a sign-in over only when this build's uploader can back up to Builderlab.
Anywhere else (a build without backup configured) the step fails at once as
*Key backup isn’t configured for this build. You can continue without a backup.* without saving
the choice. First-run failures offer retry and preserve the saved key.

When secure storage confirms absence, native recovery commands support explicit
browser sign-in. The session and recovered keys remain native; the renderer sees
only validated public identities and attempt-scoped handles. Recovery prefers the
account's current associated identity. A previous identity requires explicit
selection and does not change the account association. Failed mapping requests,
unavailable endpoints, an account refused recovery (outside a private
organization, or without Buzz access), failed backups and an empty successful
result remain distinct.
Installation uses the existing create-only secure store; cancel, reload, signout
or a competing create/import prevents stale installation.
Remembering recovered completion is best effort; retry-file failure does not block
secure-store installation. Pending uploads still require durable ciphertext before sending.
Plain signout retains backup records; Sign out and erase removes this credential
service's records through the existing resumable wipe before clearing its marker.

Rollout requires the backend backup/recovery endpoints, private-organization
authorization, database migration, and configured KMS recipient/permissions. The
client inputs must match that service's namespace. Synthetic HTTP/storage tests
do not establish live sign-in, KMS or installed-app
secure-storage acceptance. No backend provisioning or activation is part of this change.

Identity setup offers Restore when secure storage confirms that no local key is present.
The existing restore UI presents the current identity and explicit previous-identity
selection. Restoring a key saves automatic backup for it unless it has a saved
choice, since the account already holds its backup: its remembered completion
lets the next pass report it backed up without uploading it again, and the app
does not ask about it. A saved opt-out stands.

A shared credential blob can reduce repeated OS prompts by caching many credentials
after one read. For this one human key, one cached item retains that read-once benefit without
coupling human writes to agent credentials or old-app blob writers. This is not a
claim that per-secret storage is always superior or that prompts are eliminated.
Consent, app signing and update behavior require attended native verification.

## UI and sensitive data

Settings exposes Profile in Personal space as well as in a selected community.
Identity details are separate under **Buzz → Identity**, so they remain available
if the community profile cannot load. The full npub and hex public key can be
copied. The nsec is absent from the rendered field until Reveal; Copy can fetch it without revealing it. Hide, leaving Identity,
window blur and document hiding retire pending reveals and clear the displayed
secret. Failed private-key actions report fixed errors. Copy puts the key on the
OS clipboard through the host (`clipboard_write_text` with `clearAfterSecs`) on
every platform. The host marks the copy as sensitive, so clipboard managers that honor the hint
(macOS, KDE and other Linux managers) skip it and Windows keeps it out of
clipboard history and cloud sync. Buzz can't make every manager honor it. 60 seconds after the latest successful key
copy it tries to clear the clipboard, if it still holds that key. A copy of the
same key restarts the wait, and a failed copy leaves the earlier wait in place.
Failures are ignored, quitting cancels the wait, and another app can still write
between the read and the clear. On Linux the check reads the clipboard off the
main thread, because the owner may be Buzz's own GTK loop; a clipboard that
doesn't answer within 10 seconds is left alone. A read can't be stopped, so it
compares a SHA-256 fingerprint of the key, never the key, and while one read is
still waiting later checks leave the clipboard alone. The UI says Buzz tries to clear it. A key the user
selects and copies from the revealed field is not cleared, unless a Copy
button wait is still running. The one exception is the
first-run **Enter your private key** page: the typed, pasted or file-read nsec
lives only in that page's state, masked until **Reveal private key**, and
crosses IPC once, on **Continue with this key**, through `identity_import`; leaving the page
discards it, and nothing logs or persists it. On the returning-user lane the
page compares the typed key's derived npub with the account's linked npub in
the page, before IPC, so a mismatched nsec never reaches native import. The
**Welcome back** page shows the linked public key and the signed-in email; the
NIP-FI session token stays native and is never rendered.

The app UI passes a private string through IPC only during explicit import/export
interaction. JavaScript/IPC string memory is not guaranteed zeroized. Native
key bytes and temporary storage buffers use zeroizing owners, but this is not a
claim that every framework allocation is wiped. No secret is put in public
snapshots, plugin service registrations, localStorage, logs or relay events.
The main app and its same-origin plugins are trusted, not isolated security
principals; plugin JavaScript can invoke `identity_export` directly. Not registering
a plugin key service is an API ownership choice, not a sandbox. The main-webview
command permission is not proof of a human gesture.

The Identity page checks key management when it opens. Builds with a backup
service show a front pill once the key's state is known: **Backed up**, with a
destination tooltip, **Check backup** for an unconfirmed key's failed attempt, or a
spinner only while an attempt runs. Native seeds confirmation from this device's
persisted backup receipt for the key, so a launch offline or signed out shows a
backed-up key as **Backed up**. A later attempt that can't reach Builderlab, an
ended sign-in, or a failed account lookup does not unconfirm it; only the
signed-in account answering that it links no key, or another key, clears it, and
the next account handoff starts again from the receipt. Settings also withholds
**Backed up** while its own account read shows another key linked and backed
up there, even when native's pass stopped before it asked the account (for
example, waiting for consent). The receipt counts for any account, so the
tooltip and key details say the backup is with *your* account only after a pass
for the signed-in account completes or its read shows this key backed up; until
then they say *a* Builderlab account.
**Check backup** flips to the explanation and retry.
The pill sits inside the artwork, so loading cannot move the card or its controls.
Builds without a service reserve no pill space. The back uses the same concise
storage and recovery explanation for self-managed and organization-managed keys.
The local-storage explanation appears immediately and consistently calls local
secure storage **this device**. When a backup is confirmed, the same paragraph
names the configured account destination, matching the front tooltip. Native confirmation
metadata is retained, so a failed later upload alone does not erase a known backup.
The private-key menu’s save-a-copy guidance follows it.
Backup attention and retry feedback sit in the bottom action stack, with the
full **Retry backup** CTA directly above **Remove from device**. The CTA stays
disabled with a loading spinner while an attempt runs. Failure hints use centered
caption text and omit redundant retry instructions; the inline backup retry row
is removed. **Retry backup** appears only where another attempt can change the
answer. A missing sign-in has none: signing in on this page hands native a
session, which starts its own attempt. An ended sign-in keeps it, since its
session can still be live with no sign-in control on the page. Nor does a refusal
(`not_offered`, `refused`, `invalid_service`). After the fix on Builderlab's page
(key not linked, another key linked) it stays.
The **Backed up** pill appears only on the front.
Unknown backup state shows no backup claim; a failed check offers a quiet
**Backup status unknown** caption and **Retry backup** in that same bottom action
space.
One recovery control owns the status read and upload retry. With unknown
management, it rereads native state, then automatically starts a native backup
attempt when the returned management matches the current key. A read failure or
key mismatch leaves status unknown and starts no upload; an already-running
attempt is not queued again. The common recovery component owns both steps so
the CTA stays busy across the transition and card flips. Closing Settings or changing
keys before the read completes prevents starting the upload. A refused start
shows recovery feedback; native consent and sign-in checks remain authoritative.
Retrying returns focus to **Back** while the check
runs. Long back content scrolls inside the front face’s existing bounds instead of
stretching both faces. A failed later attempt preserves the confirmed account
backup explanation while the front shows **Check backup**. Only a running attempt
shows a spinner. There is no red retry action on the front. The key
menu and removal confirmation dismiss independently of Settings.
At 390px width with 200% text, the full bottom CTA labels (**Retry backup**
and **Remove from device**) can overflow the card. This shares the accepted
layout limit at that size; body copy, vertical scrolling and keyboard access
remain checked.

## Sign out of Buzz

Settings → Buzz → Identity → **Remove from device** removes Buzz’s saved private
key from this device’s secure storage and signs out. Account backups, exported
copies, and the npub and its history on relays stay. The dialog presents two
layers: the key always goes, and settings, agents and other Buzz data stay unless
the user erases them. It embeds the private-key controls above. Confirm stays
disabled until the user reveals or copies the key and ticks "I have my key".
**Also erase everything else Buzz stores on this device** (internally, wipe)
requires typing `erase all my data`; **Also remove my agents** appears only with
it; the button then reads **Sign out and erase**. Wipe clears
this app's data, local data, WebView storage, caches and plugin storage. It cannot
reach the clipboard, exported keys or relay data, and the dialog says so. Sign out
is unavailable with the development broker (`BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER`). Development
builds can sign out but not wipe: they have their own human key, but share agent
keys with the installed app, so the native command refuses
wipe. The dialog asks the native side (`sign_out_wipe_refusal`) whether wipe is
available and, when it isn't, disables wipe up front with the reason; this holds
for any Rust debug build, including a debug bundle with a production frontend. A development-build sign-out signs out every
development build, which share the debug key, and leaves the installed app
signed in. Wipe is unavailable while
`BUZZODZ_HOME` moves plugin storage out of app data.

Every running instance, debug or release under any identifier, holds two locks
shared in the user data folder (created first if a first launch finds none)
before it looks for a pending sign-out:

- a **key lock** named for its human key store (`.<service>.instance.lock`), shared
  by every copy using that key whatever its identifier. Like the sign-out marker,
  record and backup folder, it keeps the store's service from before 1.0
  (`dev.local.buzz.foundation.identity`), so files older builds wrote are still
  found; and
- the **all-Buzz lock** (`.dev.local.buzz.foundation.instance.lock`), named for
  the storage all builds share (the default plugin folder and the agent key
  service), not for the app identifier. It keeps the identifier Buzz used before
  1.0, so those builds and later ones exclude each other.

Before 1.0, Buzz's identifier was `dev.local.buzz.foundation`. Before taking these
locks, a launch as `xyz.block.buzz.desktop` renames what the old identifier names:
app data (with plugin storage), config, local data, caches, macOS WebKit storage,
their sign-out trash and a pending sign-out marker, so the update keeps
everything and finishes a sign-out the old build committed. It takes the all-Buzz
lock alone and waits for every agent ownership lock, so it never moves storage
another copy or a stopping agent still uses. If any legacy path sits beside its
new-identifier counterpart, after a rollback for instance, the launch moves
nothing, finishes no pending sign-out, and exits naming every such pair; neither copy
is safely the one to keep, and an erase would miss the legacy one. A failure exits
with a native alert, and the next launch moves what is left. Development launches
(`just desktop`, `just desktop-bundle`) use `xyz.block.buzz.desktop.dev`, so they
keep their own app data and plugin storage and never take or block the installed
app's. The first one copies the installed app's app data (without the release-only
`archive`), config, local data and macOS WebKit storage, each from
`xyz.block.buzz.desktop`, else `dev.local.buzz.foundation`, under the same locks,
so the installed app must be closed once, and takes a pending development
sign-out marker. It refuses while the installed app has a sign-out pending, so it
never copies storage being erased. A linked folder copies what it links to; links
inside are left out, so the copy shares nothing with the installed app's storage,
which stays in place. Copied folders keep who else may read them, but stay
writable by their owner. An interrupted copy finishes at the next launch.

Keys were saved under `dev.local.buzz.foundation.*` services before 1.0; they
now live under `xyz.block.buzz.desktop.*`: the human key (`.identity[.debug]`),
the agent keys (`.agents`, shared by release and development) and the TypeSafe
key (`.jev-key[.debug]`). A read looks under the new name first. Only when the
key is absent there does it look under the old name and copy what it finds,
create-only, then return the key saved under the new name. The copy holds the
old item's interprocess lock, which deleting the old item takes too, so a delete
in another Buzz can't land between its read and write. A key already there
stays, even if it differs. On macOS an agent key is looked for in the new
bundle, then its own new item, then the old bundle, then its own old item, all
under the bundle lock older builds take too. The old items stay, so an older
build still finds them. Any failure is an error for that key only, never
absence. Writes touch only the new names. Every deletion (Sign out, deleting
an agent, an erase, clearing the TypeSafe key) removes the old item before the
new one, and on macOS the agent's entry from the old bundle, so a read never
copies back a deleted key. On macOS each deletion reads again to confirm the
item is gone. Deleting an agent fails, keeping every copy, while the old bundle
is malformed.

Older builds sign out by deleting the human key under the old name only. A
record in the user data folder (`.<service>.sign-outs-seen`, next to the
finished record) keeps the count of finished sign-outs the last launch saw.
After any pending sign-out finishes, a launch that finds the count grew deletes
the human key under the new name too; the first launch only starts the count.
It decides holding the record's lock file alone, so a copy launching at the
same time sees the count this one recorded and never deletes a key saved since.
If the deletion fails, it records nothing and exits. The count is replaced by
a synced rename, and on macOS and Linux every launch syncs its folder before
any key is saved, so a power loss can't bring back a lower count and delete a
newer key. Windows has no folder sync, as for the app's other atomic writes: a
power loss right after a launch recorded a new count can lose the rename, and
the next launch then deletes a key saved in that window. Older builds record a
finished sign-out with an unsynced append on every OS, so a power loss then can
keep the deletion but lose the count, and the signed-out key under the new name
stays. Older builds' other
deletions aren't counted: after an older build erases agents or clears the
TypeSafe key, their copies under the new names stay. On macOS, Keychain may ask once to
allow the renamed app to use each saved item.

A sign-out needs its key lock alone, so every other copy using that key must be
closed. A wipe also needs the all-Buzz lock alone, so every other Buzz must be
closed. A development-build sign-out therefore needs only other development
worktrees closed, not the installed app, and the installed app's plain sign-out
doesn't need development builds closed. Locks are taken key first, then
all-Buzz, released in reverse, and never waited for while one is held alone.
Whenever an instance takes its locks shared again (after finishing a pending
sign-out, or after a refused sign-out), it looks for the marker again: at launch
a new marker is finished in turn; in a running instance it means another process
committed a sign-out, and Buzz exits natively (see below). A running instance
also exits if the sign-out record (`.<service>.sign-outs-finished`, kept forever
and shared by every identifier using the key) changed since launch: another
process finished a sign-out of its key while it let go. Retaking them
shared is bounded too; on timeout, or if a lock can't be let go, Buzz exits the
same way. These locks
coordinate running Buzz 1.0 app copies only: `buzzodz plugin sign` reads the
human key without them, under the new name else the old, and never copies it,
so Keychain items stay the app's; older Buzz versions don't take them, so close those
before signing out. The native
`sign_out` command deletes nothing: it admits one sign-out per instance, refuses
unless it can hold the locks it needs alone, writes a marker beside (not inside)
app data recording the wipe and agent choices, and restarts; agent processes
stop as they do on Quit. The marker is named for the exact human key store
(debug or release), so another build never acts on it. If the marker can't be
written nothing has changed; if a later step fails, Buzz exits natively, and the
next launch finishes the sign-out.

Once the marker is written, and before any native exit, the native signer is
closed for the rest of the process: the cached key is dropped, and every key
operation (signing, agent authorization, export, restore, import or create)
refuses when it runs, including calls that started before it closed. Pairing
closes in the same close step: the live attempt is cancelled before it can publish a
payload it already prepared, and no new attempt starts. Work admitted before
the close isn't recalled: a payload admitted before pairing closes may still be
sent or delivered (an outcome not yet known is reported as uncertain), and signatures and agent authorizations
already issued remain valid. A native exit runs the same best-effort teardown as Quit, then shows a native
alert and exits however that went; the dialog never offers a retry or Cancel
once this instance's locks or agents are in an unknown state. Agents don't
outlive Buzz: each runs under a supervisor that stops it when Buzz's socket
closes, holding that agent's ownership lock (`dev.local.buzz.agent-ownership`
in the user data folder) until it has stopped. A supervisor that can't stop its
agent keeps the lock.

A launch that finds the marker takes its key lock alone, and for a wipe the
all-Buzz lock too, waiting briefly for the exiting instance, then reads the
marker once more and runs only choices those locks cover: if it has meanwhile
become a wipe, the launch lets go and starts over to take every lock. Before a
wipe, it tries every agent ownership lock; if any is still held, it removes
nothing and exits with a native alert that an agent is still stopping, so a
later launch retries. A plain sign-out skips this: it removes only the human
key, and the ownership folder is shared with every Buzz, so another copy's
running agents would block it. A marker
that can't be read or parsed fails closed. It finishes before any window,
webview storage, service or identity read:

1. With remove agents, every agent's locally stored key is deleted, read from
   the agent registry, which stays in place until all are gone. That includes
   imported deployed-remote agents, whose import kept a local copy; the remote
   deployment itself is not stopped or deleted.
2. With wipe, app data, local data, WebView storage and caches are renamed
   aside. App data's agent folder (`agent-controller`) is put back unless agents
   were removed.
3. The human item is deleted and a fresh read must find it absent.
4. The renamed folders and anything recreated in place are deleted, then the
   sign-out record advances, then the marker is removed. Kept agents keep only
   what they need to be identified and start again: the agent list with their
   settings (`agents.json`), the shared agent defaults (`defaults.json`),
   including any API keys entered in their settings, and their keys in the
   keychain. Everything else in `agent-controller`, including saved Databricks
   logins, logs and anything added there later, is deleted; a kept Databricks
   agent must sign in again. The dialog says both.

Every step is safe to repeat: deleting an absent key succeeds, and an agent
registry confirmed absent means its keys are already gone; failing to check it
stops before anything moves. The wipe never acts through a link at Buzz's own
folders: every wiped folder, its `.sign-out-trash` sibling, the kept
`agent-controller` in both, and the agent list when agents are removed must be a
real folder or absent. This is checked before the marker is written, before
anything moves, and again right before every move, rollback and delete. The OS
storage folders above them (`Application Support`, `Caches`, `~/Library/WebKit`)
are trusted as the app already trusts them, so if one is a link the wipe removes
only Buzz's folder under it. The wipe is not designed to resist another program
swapping folders while it runs. Every other presence check in the wipe is fallible
too: one that can't look fails the attempt, keeping the marker. If renaming or the key delete fails, the renames are rolled back. On any failure
the marker is kept and Buzz shows a native error and exits without opening a
window, so nothing recreates wiped storage and the next launch retries. Without
wipe, local data stays: it is already scoped by public key, so signing back in
with the same key finds it. Native federated sessions are removed by the same
sign-out owner across indexed profiles and configurations. Without FI, Builderlab and
hosted-community logins live only in memory and end with the restart; an FI build signs
them in through the native FI session instead, which restores after it. Kept agents start only while the signed-in key
matches the owner in their saved attestation, checked before their key is read.

## Automatic backup consent hooks

The native identity service exposes `getBackupChoice()` and
`setBackupChoice(pubkey, automatic)`. These APIs expose public metadata and do not
change identity readiness. Reading a choice does not contact a server; saving
automatic backup wakes the existing native uploader if a session is connected.
Builderlab first run discloses automatic backup before replacing or importing a
key, says the account manages a key it creates, then enables backup after
linking. Importing a key the account already holds a backup of is disclosed and
enabled too unless it has a saved choice, but setup uploads nothing; with
automatic backup on, the uploader's next pass with a session backs it up again
from this device. A saved opt-out stands, and the notice says so. There is no separate first-run backup-choice
screen. An independent import without Builderlab sign-in and **Continue with
your Buzz identity?** save no choice. **Continue without backup** keeps what the
failed step saved: no choice on a build that can't back up to Builderlab, which
fails before saving one, but automatic backup when the account isn't offered it,
so that key is never asked about and each later pass ends as not offered.

Outside a managed build, a key with no saved choice is never backed up. Once the
app is open, never during first run, the renderer fills the choice in whenever
the uploader waits for consent (which it does only with a Builderlab session on
a configured build): at launch, on a Builderlab sign-in, after a key install
such as old Buzz's, and when the saved community memberships change. Nothing is
decided or asked while the launch screen shows or old Buzz's communities are
being offered or added; it then decides with the communities that import added.
A refused save or failed read decides again on the next community update.
Membership in any community this build's Builderlab hosts, by the welcome
screen's `builderlab-hosted.ts` list matched on the saved relay host alone (no
relay is read for its `self`), saves automatic backup with no prompt, unless
a choice was saved since it was read: the save checks under the choice lock.
Otherwise **Back up your key?** asks; it says that a self-managed key needs a
kept copy of its private key to use the account on another device or after
losing access to this one. **Back up key** and **I will manage my own
key** save the answer, which a hosted
membership arriving while it is saved does not override; closing it saves
nothing, and it asks again on the next launch or Builderlab sign-in. A build
whose Builderlab hosts no listed community, including an FI build, always asks.
Settings → Identity's card shows the uploader's status and keeps recovery on
its back. While it waits for consent, **Back up this key to Builderlab** appears
above a prominent **Back up key** action in the bottom stack. It opens the same
consent prompt before any choice is saved; the prompt closes if the wait settles
without its answer. Cancel restores the action's focus; saving consent or an
externally settled wait returns focus to **Back**. **Retry backup** and the
consent action share that slot, so retry never bypasses consent.
When the key isn’t linked to the account, or the account holds a different
key, the notice’s **Builderlab** opens Settings → Plugins → Builderlab, whose
**Connect Buzz identity** or **Switch to this device’s identity** is the next
step. Both states arise only after consent. The link is available only while
Builderlab’s Settings card is registered; the sign-in wait stays plain text.
Settings does not turn automatic backup off. A successful restore, and a
welcome-back import of a key the account already backs up, save automatic
backup the same way, only when the key has no saved choice.

An automatic choice is bound to the current public key and the trusted
build-configured backup service and namespace; a self-managed choice holds for its
public key under every service, namespace and choice version. Missing or
mismatched metadata otherwise returns no choice; unreadable metadata fails closed.
An unavailable build rejects choice writes.
Debug and release use their existing separate key-custody namespaces. Only the
main WebView can read or save the choice.
Plain sign-out retains the choice; sign-out and erase removes it through the
existing resumable wipe, without erasing the other key-custody namespace.

The native uploader consumes `nsec_backup_choice::read` before any
backup request and retain its returned value through the upload. Its shared file
lease prevents a successful choice change from racing an admitted upload across
app copies. Saving a choice reports busy while such a lease is held, unless it
turns automatic backup on where it is already on for that key, service and
namespace: the running pass already backs it up, so the saved choice is returned
without a write. Disabling
automatic backup governs future uploads and does not delete existing backups.
The consent hooks are the base of the draft stack:
#1137 consent hooks → #1106 gated uploader → #1107 recovery → #1101 restore UI.

## Native federated session module

Federated identity ([NIP-FI](https://github.com/block/buzz/blob/main/docs/nips/NIP-FI.md),
[NIP-FA](https://github.com/block/buzz/blob/main/docs/nips/NIP-FA.md)) adds a native
owner separate from the human Nostr key, one per sign-in server: each compiled
one, and each Builderlab customer's server, added when its first community
connects and again at every later launch. The servers are documented in
[configuration](configuration.md#federated-identity-build-input). Each relay is
routed by its host to the server that covers it, never by anything the relay
publishes; that server issues its assertions and later checks ask it alone. A
community no server covers connects without a token. The build's first server
is its Builderlab: the bundled plugin, agent credentials and Settings use its
session, and the native commands act on it unless given a community `relay`,
which a community's sign-in prompt passes so it signs in to that community's
server. The native commands return status, authority, revision, optional email,
and fixed failure codes. Session tokens and assertion headers are native-only.

Sign-in uses the existing native loopback callback owner with NIP-FA `return_to`
and an S256 handoff challenge, exchanges the code natively, and verifies the
fixed session expiry before persistence. Restore checks the stored credential
against `/v1/session`; failed reads and unrecognized refusals do not authorize
replacement. Local expiry, cancellation, and sign-out fence stale work.
Sign-out also asks the server to end the session, best effort: one `POST` to
`v1/auth/logout` under the identity origin's API base path, with the session as
`X-BB-Session-Credential` and no `Authorization`. Native follows no redirect
and ignores the result, so sign-out never waits for it and works offline. It
ends only the session this copy held, never one read back from the secure
store. Sign out of Buzz, expiry and refusals end nothing at the server.
An explicit sign-out of a server (Settings' **Sign out**, **Switch account**,
first run's **Use a different account**) also marks that server: its next
sign-in sends `prompt=login` whatever the caller asks: it asks the sign-in
provider to authenticate again instead of finishing on the browser's session as
the account just signed out. The provider decides what the browser shows, and
the browser's session there is not ended. The mark is a file beside the server's
FI records (`<account>.signed-out`), so it survives a restart, and only a
completed browser sign-in or renewal removes it. A session restored from another
copy takes the mark as the file has it: that session may have been checked
before another copy's sign-out, so it never erases the mark. Expiry, refusals
and close never set it, so renewing the same account stays one click. Sign out of Buzz leaves an existing mark in place.

The browser callback shows that sign-in was received and attempts to close after
three seconds. After verified session installation, macOS can return focus to
the visible Buzz window while the captured sign-in browser is still foreground.
Cancellation, sign-out, replacement and failed verification retire that attempt's
return permission. Other platforms keep manual focus return.

FI records use the OS secure-store service
`xyz.block.buzz.desktop.federated-session` (with `.debug` for Rust debug
builds), keyed by profile and each server's deployment fingerprint, so a build's
first server keeps the sessions it saved as the only server. Neither includes the
app identifier: like the human key, copies in one debug/release namespace that
use the same server (Buzz and Buzz Staging both use the public server) share its
session. A signed-out copy reads the item again before a browser sign-in and
adopts a session another copy saved. A completed browser sign-in, including a
renewal, saves over whatever session the item holds. When another copy already
ended or replaced the session, a sign-out here finishes signed out, and an
expiry or refusal here ends it as expired; both leave the newer session alone.
A signed-in copy keeps its session until it restarts, even after another copy
signs out, unless that sign-out ended the same session at the server: this
copy then ends it when the server next refuses it. On macOS one item per
profile and deployment holds the session and every agent grant, so Keychain
prompts once; Windows and Linux keep one item per record. Older macOS items
move into it on read. This is a one-way development migration: close older
Buzz copies, including other debug worktrees, before the first upgraded launch
and use the upgraded build afterward. An older copy still running can write a
grant the bundle no longer reads, which leaves that agent stopped. Release builds already run one instance. Account indices and
revision-specific refusal markers contain no credential and live outside wiped
Buzz data. Failed removal of a known record leaves refusal durable before any
secure-store access, so that revision cannot restore until cleanup succeeds.
Sign out of Buzz removes indexed FI records across profiles/configurations in
its debug/release namespace before deleting the human key or opening a WebView.

The app's `federatedIdentity` service exposes this public state to the shared
sign-in UI. Session record revision survives restore and scopes account caches
without inventing a NIP-FA subject.

NIP-11 discovery from the exact relay carries no FI credential. The community
requires NIP-FI when its top-level `requires_nip_fi` is true; when that flag is
absent, `limitation.federated_identity` decides, as before it existed. A false
`requires_nip_fi` means not required even where the host supports NIP-FI (as a
shadow-mode host advertises), and a non-boolean one is invalid discovery. Not
required retains ordinary Nostr transport. Required needs the supported
client-attached/offline-jwt descriptor and compiled authority mapping. Assertions
are acquired with native same-key NIP-98 proof and checked for exact audience,
key, and lifetime. Native HTTP, media, repository Git reads/imports, and socket
upgrades attach the assertion beside their existing possession proof. Protected
socket workers stop by assertion expiry; the existing live owner reconnects and
performs fresh NIP-42. Retirement fences protected reads and results.

### Local agent federated credentials

Each local agent enrolls using the signed-in owner's session and its own NIP-98
proof. The native agent-token owner stores the resulting grant beside session
records in the same OS secure-store service, keyed by profile, deployment, owner
public key and agent public key: in the session's item on macOS, under a
separate key elsewhere. Grants never cross IPC. An assertion header leaves
native code in two places only, each bound to the agent's key (NIP-FI,
Assertion–key binding), so it is useless without that key's signatures. The
`repo` tool's Git headers pair it with a NIP-98 proof bound to one repository
URL for 60 seconds; Git asks for an assertion valid for at least 70 seconds and
fails rather than accept a shorter one. The local credential service below
answers `federated_identity` with an assertion valid for at least 60 seconds.
Enrollment validates the returned owner and issuer;
assertions are checked for the agent key, issuer, relay audience and lifetime.
The relay remains responsible for signature and authorization verification.

An enrolled grant survives ordinary owner-session expiry and same-account
restoration. Organization sign-out, another account or agent deletion retires it.
Account installation records required retirement before persisting the new session;
interrupted cleanup resumes before grants are admitted. Enrollment also rechecks
its session revision, so a caller paused before reservation cannot install a
credential from a retired session.

A refused grant permits one replacement enrollment while the owner is signed in.
Replacement attempts preserve that budget across transient errors. Before enrollment
or replacement issuance, the same secure-store record reserves a token-free stop
scoped to the persisted session revision. Terminal refusal, restart or interrupted
issuance cannot silently start another enrollment. A new sign-in revision or
explicit agent deletion permits a reset; ordinary restore of the same session does
not. Failure to persist the reservation prevents dispatch. A known transient
outcome releases it only if that storage write succeeds.

The `/v1/nip-fi/agent-grant` and `/v1/nip-fi/agent-assertion` routes and
`Nostr-Agent-Proof` header are this configured adapter's wire contract, not
standard endpoints defined by NIP-FI/NIP-FA. NIP-FI defines the
`nip-fi-agent+jwt` assertion class and owner checks; that does not establish
interoperability with another adapter's enrollment endpoints.

### Local credential service

A process the app launches for an agent can run the `buzz` CLI as that agent
without its key. Native code serves block/buzz's local credential provider
contract (`docs/local-credential-provider.md`) on `127.0.0.1` and puts the
caller's endpoint and a fresh 256-bit token in the process's
`BUZZ_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER`. The service looks tokens up by their SHA-256, and
no token is written to disk or logged. A host shared by several agents (Codex,
Pi) also keeps each agent's raw token in memory, and the page passes it over
Tauri IPC and the host's stdin to that agent's tools. The CLI builds each event and asks
the service to sign it; keys, NIP-44 conversation keys and grants never leave
native code.

- **One identity.** A token acts for nobody until the runtime binds it, once, to
  the agent its process serves. A plugin may bind only to an agent of its own
  type. Claude Code's shared spare is bound when an agent takes it.
- **What it signs.** Every event passes the contract's operation policy before
  signing. NIP-42, NIP-98 and Blossom proofs are signed only for the token's own
  community and only when created within a minute of now. Ordinary content kinds
  are signed as built. Profile, contacts, deletions, membership, moderation and
  agent-management kinds are refused with `denied`: a local tool can't sign
  them, and there is no approval prompt. Every other kind is denied too.
- **Evidence.** `federated_identity` goes through the same agent grant and
  assertion checks as the app's own requests and answers no header on relays
  without NIP-FI. `auth_tag` answers the agent's NIP-OA tag.
- **Limits and revocation.** Each token has a request budget per method and
  answers `rate_limited` with a retry delay. It is revoked as soon as its
  process exits, even while a descendant still holds its output or
  environment, and for good once its agent is deleted, the owner signs out or
  changes account, or the identity closes: each request rechecks the owner's
  retirement count recorded when the token was issued and the agent's
  incarnation recorded at binding, and a
  closed identity issues no token.
- **Callers.** Requests must name the bound address in `Host` and carry no
  `Origin`, so a web page cannot use it. A process serving one agent
  carries its token (Claude Code, and goose, which runs one process per
  agent). A process serving several (Codex, Pi) carries none; each agent's
  token goes only into that agent's tool commands and is revoked when the
  process exits. Windows has no transport in version 1 and gets none.

Builderlab's remote-agent, hosted-community, known-community, Decisions, Apps,
Apps viewer and backup calls all use the native FI session of the build's first
sign-in server. The only other Builderlab sign-ins are the development broker's
in live development and key recovery's own browser sign-in
([above](#automatic-backup-and-optional-recovery)), which may pick a different
account. The renderer names only the public session revision. For API calls,
native checks the plugin's authority/operation grant, enabled artifact
revision, live registration and that revision; the Apps viewer exchange and
backup check only that the revision is current. Apps agent tools send the
session to the Apps control plane (below); other API calls and Decisions send
it as `Authorization: Bearer` to the server's identity origin. The Apps viewer
exchange sends it as `X-BB-Session-Credential` to the identity origin's
hosted-site native-session route, with no `Authorization` header, which that
route refuses. Backup sends it as `Authorization: Bearer` to the backup
service, used only when that service is the identity origin and API base path.
A 401 on an API or Decisions call fails that call without ending the session;
native then checks the adapter's `GET /v1/session` once and ends the session
only if the adapter refuses it there. Builderlab's
Settings card has no sign-out of its own: it links to Identity →
Organization sign-in, which ends the shared session.

Builderlab Apps' agent tools use the same session, as `bl apps` does. Only the
bundled Builderlab plugin may ask, and only for `/v1/agent/` paths: native
sends them to the Apps control plane paired with the server's identity origin
(`apps_control_plane` in the plugin manager) with the session as
`Authorization: BBIdentity`. A deploy names a `.tar.gz` file in the home
directory, which native reads and uploads itself, with the same checks as a
plugin upload. A 401 is handled as for API calls.

Settings → Identity → Community sign-ins is the same whichever community is
open. It shows cards for each configured server, its name and origin, account,
and saved communities that require its sign-in. Static community artwork exposes
names and tooltips. **Sign out** confirms before ending that server’s session only.
Within seven days of expiry, **Renew sign-in** and the expiry date appear, with
**Sign out** in the renewal caret menu. The Builderlab connection row observes
the existing plugin session and opens its settings; it starts no account read.
A sign-out native could not finish (for example, secure storage refused) stays below the list, naming the
server, with **Try again**; so does an ended session whose saved record native
could not remove. A saved session native could not check, for example offline,
is kept and offers no **Try again**. Communities no server covers are not listed.
While the build’s Builderlab isn’t signed in, its row to sign in from stays listed alongside the other configured servers, with its recovery
message when applicable.

When a community refuses a signed-in account (`authorization-denied` or
`binding-mismatch`), its prompt names the community's server and account, and
the other joined communities that require its sign-in, and offers **Switch
account**: it signs out of that server only, signs in to it again, and retries. Other
servers' sessions are not touched. While it runs the prompt says so, with
**Cancel sign-in** during the browser step. A canceled sign-in leaves that
server signed out: the prompt says the sign-in was canceled and offers
**Sign in**. A refused or failed step names the server and offers **Try
again**, which repeats the step that failed: after a failed sign-out it signs
out again before signing in, so it never renews the old account. **Not now**
closes the prompt and changes nothing. Binding-mismatch recovery points to that
server's identity origin.

### Sign in at launch

A build whose descriptor sets `"signIn": "at-launch"` treats organization
sign-in as part of opening the app. After key setup, the launch mark stays up
while the saved session is checked. A restored session opens the app directly.
Otherwise a full-window screen titled "Signing you in to *organization*" opens
the browser sign-in, and the app opens when it finishes. Cancel or a failed
sign-in leaves **Sign in with *organization*** and **Not now**; neither reopens
the browser by itself. Not now opens the app, where protected communities offer
their usual sign-in recovery.

When the session ends during a run (expiry or the adapter refusing it), the same
screen covers the app, above any dialog or menu it had open, and starts sign-in
again. The app stays mounted, covered and inert, so drafts, scroll and
navigation survive, and focus returns to where it was. An explicit sign-out
shows the screen without opening the browser. A saved session that cannot be
checked (network or secure storage) offers Try again, and the screen stays up
while it checks.

Before the session expires, a persistent warning names when it ends and offers
**Sign in again**. It appears 72 hours ahead, or halfway through a shorter
session. Signing in again keeps the current session working until the new one
is exchanged; Cancel or a failure leaves it in place, and a different account
retires derived agent grants as any account change does. At expiry, native ends
the session itself rather than waiting for the next relay assertion or 401, and
the screen above takes over.
On-demand builds are unchanged.

The Node development host retains its supported broker flow.

For the community sign-in and recovery UI alone, run the environment-free
fixture server documented below and open `/tests/fixtures/federated-identity.html`.
Click **Sign in**, then **Cancel sign-in** or **Complete** in fixture controls;
verify the prompt switches to **Cancel sign-in** and clears once signed in.
**Binding mismatch** shows existing identity-link guidance; **Storage failure**
shows recovery without claiming success. It does not exercise the running app's
full navigation or native credentials.

## Packaged connection

A public native viewer hydrates the existing public-key-scoped local profile and
memberships. On macOS, Windows and Linux, app composition supplies the shared
native relay adapter after identity restoration. Windows/Linux installed-app
transport acceptance remains unverified. Only the selected saved community opens on restart; Personal
space stays disconnected. Discovery failure leaves the community retryable.
Native sessions do **not** fall through to the dev broker signer.

The native identity owner signs event templates and authenticates HTTP with
NIP-98, including the exact request URL, method, a body hash on POST and a fresh nonce
for each attempt. Native networking permits only discovery, join-policy, invite
mint/acceptance/claim, relay-advertised GIF search, query, event and bounded
workflow run-history routes on HTTPS origins, with bounded bodies, timeouts and
no redirects. JavaScript never obtains the private key for transport. NIP-11
`self` establishes relay authority; the operator-contact `pubkey` is not a
substitute. The existing live owner handles WSS/NIP-42 authentication and
signature verification. IPC permissions remain limited to the main WebView.

Relay staff console requests (`relay_admin_*`) use a separate native owner.
The admin origin comes only from the selected relay's NIP-11 `admin_api` and
must be a public HTTPS host. Every probe, read, write, attachment fetch and
retry resolves that host, refuses the request if any answer is loopback,
private, link-local or otherwise reserved (or if DNS fails or returns nothing),
and connects only to the vetted addresses while keeping the hostname for TLS
and NIP-98. That client ignores system proxies and follows no redirects. The
webview names a closed route; native code builds the URL, checks the request's
expected relay, admin origin and signer before signing, and caps each response.

When there is a selected identity and relay and the relay advertises a valid
admin host, opening Settings sends one signed role check (`probe`, `GET
/api/admin/v1/probe`, empty body) to that host without a further click, so the
Moderation entries show only to staff (a relay with admin auth off shows its
read-only entries to everyone). Every member who opens Settings sends it, not
only staff, because only the answer says who is staff. It goes to whatever
admin host the relay advertises, which can differ from the community's
connection host and need not share its domain. That host learns the active
public key, the client's IP address and that Settings was opened; no private
key, login token or community data is sent. The NIP-98 signature is bound to
that URL, method and body and carries a timestamp, so it can't be used for any
other request, and a conforming server rejects it after a short window (this
relay allows ±60 seconds); the recipient can still keep it. A relay that names
another deployment's real admin host lets that deployment's staff see and act
on that deployment from inside the wrong relay's Settings, subject to that
deployment's permissions; the relay that named it receives none of that
traffic. The practical risk is confusion about which deployment is being
administered, and each console screen names the admin host in its subtitle,
which limits it. This is accepted because the user already trusts the relay to
name its admin host, and sending that host the key, the IP address and when
Settings was opened is part of that trust. It repeats each time Settings
opens, re-reading the advertised admin host first, and each newly selected
identity or relay is checked once while Settings stays open. Other re-checks
(a 401 or 403, Check again, changing your own staff entry) are listed in
[relay-staff.md](relay-staff.md); none starts after Settings closes.

Channel lifecycle/details and identity archive commands, channel recipe preparation/decoding,
and opening direct messages use purpose-bound native commands. Creation kind 9007 is
advertised only when NIP-11 reports NIP-29 support. NIP-44 stays in the native
identity owner; recipe plaintext is never returned by a generic decrypt command.

Community admission, kind-0 profile reads/publication, the NIP-43 leave request
(kind 28936, signed only in its empty protected shape) and the adapter's advertised
message/event writes use this identity. [Join recovery](communities.md#packaged-admission-and-recovery)
records public progress before remote changes. The existing durable outbox retains
uncertain delivery across restart; retry uses the same signed event with fresh HTTP
authentication. Events older than 15 minutes get a strong ID readback instead of
being republished or silently re-dated. For ordinary messages, missing/failed
readback retains uncertainty; inspect the conversation before explicitly sending
another. Expired no-role Solo invitations have a narrower verified retirement
path through [Outbox Retry](solo/sharing.md).

Protected media and uploads are native, because the webview cannot attach Blossom
(kind 24242) authentication itself: `<img>`, `<video>` and `<audio>` send no custom
headers, and the CSP keeps `connect-src` closed to general HTTPS; it admits only
the `buzz-media` scheme, whose bytes the requesting window may already read (such
as an agent card's embedded definition). Relay `/media/`
URLs selected by shared TypeScript render through the `buzz-media` URI scheme;
`<video>` and `<audio>` instead load the same URLs from a native listener on
`127.0.0.1`, since WebKitGTK cannot play a custom scheme. It authorizes each
request by a random per-launch path token given only to the main window, the
bound `Host` and the app's `Origin`, and serves one request per connection.
Both validate HTTPS and the `/media/<hash>` URL shape but do not enforce
saved-community membership; the selected server receives a short-lived token
scoped to its origin. The scheme signs a fresh 60-second `get` token per request
and forwards only a bounded single `Range`; non-image/video/audio types (and SVG)
are served with download disposition and `nosniff`. The main webview does not navigate to protected media for downloads: a narrowly scoped native command authenticates the bounded media GET, saves to the OS Downloads directory without replacing existing files, and rejects unsafe filenames. On macOS, the main webview's native media menu also saves relay media to Downloads without replacing existing files, but under the blob's `<hash>.<ext>` name rather than the attachment name, and removes the partial file if a download fails or Buzz quits before it finishes. It refuses media of unknown length or larger than the largest video Buzz uploads. The menu omits the items that would copy, open or share the tokened loopback URL, and its Download item when Buzz cannot save it. `relay_upload`
hashes, signs (`upload` + `x`) and sends the exact bytes JavaScript passes it,
then requires the successful response's SHA-256 and size to match those bytes.
Shared TypeScript (`hostUpload`) owns limits, error mapping and the remaining
descriptor validation. JavaScript never signs kind 24242. Packaged HEIC and video
preparation uses fixed demuxers and ffmpeg arguments in the native host, then
hashes and uploads only the converted bytes; JavaScript receives the descriptor,
not the prepared file. ffmpeg must be installed on the computer.
Community member changes (NIP-43 kinds 9030–9032) are signed in the host only
in the exact add/remove/role shape; the relay decides authority. Repository HTTP
and other broker-only helpers are not claimed by this adapter.
Windows/Linux custody, credential migration and release-signing acceptance remain
separate limitations.

Development with a public `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` pin enables the legacy broker
(Vite derives `VITE_BUZZ_LIVE=1`), even inside `just desktop`, and does not offer
native private-key controls. `just desktop` passes Vite's effective public pin
(including an explicitly empty shell override) to the native app. The public pin
alone is not authorization. Packaged builds always use native identity, ignoring
the pin. This reuses the broker's trusted-local-process boundary; it does not copy
keys or introduce another signing protocol.

Without the pin, supported desktop development uses
the native identity path; see the [host-mode matrix](contributing.md#shared-logic-and-host-boundaries). Creating/importing the
new native item does not update that old blob. Future reset/rotation would not
synchronize copies automatically; neither operation is in this scope. Sign out
does not touch that old blob.

## Try the UI without credentials

Use the existing environment-free fixture Vite config:

```sh
bin/pnpm exec vite --config tests/fixtures/agent-control.vite.mjs --port 1547
```

Open `/tests/fixtures/identity.html`. It renders the key import/create screen
(not the first-launch welcome) with mock IPC and an in-memory public
fixture key, not an OS credential store or a relay. Import accepts only the
displayed fixture key. Reset and simulated restart affect fixture state only. **Never enter a real
nsec.** Browser exercises prove UI behavior, not secure native persistence.

Before real-key use or a usable-release claim: independent custody review,
isolated native consent/denial/import/create/restart checks, human UI feedback,
and installed-app live read/send/receipt/restart acceptance are still required.
Do not launch/restart someone's desktop app or inspect their credentials to test.

### Windows/Linux native acceptance (not established by the fixture)

Use a disposable **OS account/VM**, not a profile, port or HOME override: credentials
are per OS user. Use only throwaway keys, keep old Buzz closed for import handover,
and do not connect that identity to a real community for this storage check.

- On Windows and Linux with a working Secret Service/default collection, create
  or import, export the throwaway key, quit/relaunch, and confirm the same public
  identity and export. Repeat separately for debug and release builds.
- With an existing Linux key locked, dismiss the unlock request. Expect a storage
  error/retry, not first-run create/import choices; unlock and retry to restore.
  Without Secret Service, expect an error rather than key generation/fallback.
- Where two development instances can run, an occupied human/agent item must not
  be overwritten. Lock contention must be retryable; after exit, locks release.

Deferred until agent import is reachable from the UI on Windows/Linux:
explicitly import a throwaway old-Buzz agent, restart and verify the exact key,
then delete only the destination agent and verify the old source remains. This is
not a reachable UI acceptance step for this storage slice and does not establish
Windows execution.

Attended Windows/Linux execution and human confirmation are release gates, not
claims made by cross-compilation, fake-store tests, or the browser fixture.
