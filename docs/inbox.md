# Inbox: in-progress port

Inbox is currently a bundled placeholder page (`buzz.inbox/inbox`). This
stacked PR's session evidence is not displayed until the dependent Inbox UI PR.
No new navigation behavior is part of this evidence slice.

## Evidence slice (stacked with Inbox UI)

PR3 adds no Inbox UI. The subsequent Inbox page uses `session.unread.inbox()` as
its single conversation projection and `session.inboxFeed` as bounded addressed
history demand. These changes are one launch batch, not a separately shippable
backend feature. Ordinary channel and thread readers, read-state storage and
outbox retain their existing ownership. No projects, approvals or reminders.

## Ownership and limits

`session.unread.inbox()` / `subscribeInbox()` own retained verified unread
evidence and read actions. `session.inboxFeed` owns finite, verified addressed
history and live reconciliation. Its admitted channel events contribute to the
shared unread fold, never a second raw row projection that could resurrect
own/deleted messages or invent unresolved conversation roots. Inbox renders these
shared conversation rows directly; there is no second project/approval row merge.
The feed retains a bounded chat snapshot and membership reprojection, but it
is not a separate row or read-state owner. Arrivals and admitted deletions
reconcile within the attempt's bound and generation. PR4 will own only
presentation, filtering and selection. No parallel signing or persistence is
added. Optional profile enrichment belongs to PR4; access, cache clear and
session retirement fence these projections. Opening Inbox does not mark rows
read; selecting an unread row does. Canonical Messages keeps its own reading
behavior.

DM read clears the channel through its newest retained evidence. Thread read
advances the thread prefix, including earlier unshown replies, plus individually
represented top-level mentions and local message marks, but not unrelated
messages. Multiple steps are not atomic: failures leave remaining evidence
retryable. Manual unread is local to this device. Hosts without frontier-sync
disable read mutations. Saved frontiers are not proof of remote reconciliation.

This is **bounded recent evidence**, not a complete historical inbox. Unread
retains at most 4,096 events / 8 MiB, observing up to 500 recent events per
128-channel roster batch. A lazy addressed query returns up to 50 kind-9/40002
messages. For those exact IDs and unresolved failed targets, general `#e`
queries page signed kind-40003 edits and kind-5/9005 deletions, then deletions
of the edits; `include_aux` on an ordinary `#p` query is not a supported relay
contract. Both auxiliary stages must finish before the feed is ready. Retained
unread evidence can be provisionally admitted between queries, but exact target
IDs are marked incomplete **before** unread subscribers are notified. The
consumer must not show their body as current while incomplete; failures retain
that metadata and offer retry. This is a completeness signal, not atomic content
admission or a second message fold. A target outside the latest 50 addressed
rows is not discovered; if a failed target falls outside a later page its
bounded auxiliary check still runs before its incomplete flag is cleared.
Auxiliary reads cap retained results at 2,000 events / 4 MiB; the shared reader
keeps its existing per-request deadline and cancellation. Missing roots,
participation or older activity can omit rows; an empty Inbox does not prove
complete history. No polling, independent row source or channel window is
opened for the feed. Access/cache/disconnect/disposal fence pending reads; local
read intent remains with unread. Packaged/native acceptance and human visual
feedback remain separate.

Reminders and their NIP-ER lifecycle are **not included** in this change.
The unfinished reminder prototype is preserved separately for later work,
not shipped in the Inbox source or broker routes. Follow/mute Inbox policy,
full backlog discovery and nonchat activity are outside this slice. Project and
approval queries, grouping, routing and detail presentation are deliberately
excluded rather than presented as partial parity. Native/ACP packaged acceptance and human visual feedback
remain open. Do not treat this as the full OG Inbox port.

## Verification status

`inbox-feed.test.ts` exercises the real session reader/visibility/unread owners
with signed ephemeral events, including the first-admission subscriber ordering,
held edit and tombstone reads, failure/retry, reentrant access removal and cache
reset, root regrouping, and an edited addressed target older than 500 ordinary
messages. `unread.test.ts` retains the current main read/catch-up behavior and
adds Inbox projection/read-state cases. Neither file establishes browser paint,
real relay persistence or packaged/native acceptance. PR4 must cover the
per-row pending/failed presentation contract and exact inline previews.
