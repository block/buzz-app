# Inbox: in-progress port

Inbox is currently a bundled placeholder page (`buzz.inbox/inbox`). This
stacked PR's session evidence is not displayed until the dependent Inbox UI PR.
No new navigation behavior is part of this evidence slice.

## Evidence slice (stacked with Inbox UI)

PR3 adds no Inbox UI. The subsequent Inbox page uses `session.unread.inbox()` as
its single conversation projection and `session.inboxFeed` as bounded addressed
history demand. These changes are one launch batch, not a separately shippable
backend feature. Ordinary channel and thread readers, read-state storage and
outbox retain their existing ownership. No projects, approvals or reminders.

## Ownership and limits

`session.unread.inbox()` / `subscribeInbox()` own retained verified unread
evidence and read actions. `session.inboxFeed` owns finite, verified addressed
history demand and exact incomplete-target metadata, not a row cache. Finite
results and live arrivals, edits and deletions use the existing session admission
and shared unread fold, so own/deleted messages stay absent and unresolved roots
never become duplicate conversations. Current membership gates the feed's
completeness targets and unread's rows; joining alone does not materialize
pre-membership history without fresh shared admission. Inbox renders those shared
conversation rows directly; there is no second project/approval row merge or
feed-owned reconciliation buffer and deletion-count abort. PR4 owns only
presentation, filtering and selection. No parallel signing or persistence is
added. Optional profile enrichment belongs to PR4; access, cache clear and
session retirement fence these projections. Opening Inbox does not mark rows
read; selecting an unread row does. Canonical Messages keeps its own reading
behavior.

DM read clears the channel through its newest retained evidence. Thread read
advances the thread prefix, including earlier unshown replies, plus individually
represented top-level mentions and local message marks, but not unrelated
messages. Participation follows the shared unread owner's direct-parent policy,
including its existing bounded lookups for replies whose membership is undecided.
Fetched roots and participation witnesses remain structural, never extra Inbox rows.
A lookup-only root uses the existing exact-message manual-unread target until counted
root evidence arrives; its known root still supplies grouping and read-through.
Relevant replies remain thread activity even when the root cannot be fetched.
Multiple steps are not atomic: failures leave remaining evidence retryable. Manual unread is local to this device. Hosts without frontier-sync
disable read mutations. Saved frontiers are not proof of remote reconciliation.

This is **bounded recent evidence**, not a complete historical inbox. Unread
retains at most 4,096 events / 8 MiB, observing up to 500 recent events per
128-channel roster batch. A lazy addressed query returns up to 50 kind-9/40002
messages. For those exact IDs and unresolved failed targets, general `#e`
queries page signed kind-40003 edits and kind-5/9005 deletions, then deletions
of the edits; `include_aux` on an ordinary `#p` query is not a supported relay
contract. Both auxiliary stages must finish before the feed is ready. Retained
unread evidence can be provisionally admitted between queries, but exact target
IDs are marked incomplete **before** unread subscribers are notified. The
consumer must not show their body as current while incomplete; failures retain
that metadata and offer retry. This is a completeness signal, not atomic content
admission or a second message fold. A target outside the latest 50 addressed
rows is not discovered; if a failed target falls outside a later page its
bounded auxiliary check still runs before its incomplete flag is cleared.
Incomplete obligations survive disconnect and unrelated access revocation while
the corresponding readable unread evidence survives; full cache/session retirement
clears both. Tombstone checks include retained author edits even if a later relay
query omits their soft-deleted rows. If reference visibility withholds an auxiliary
event, the finite attempt stays failed/incomplete rather than treating the filtered
page as exhausted history. Explicit Retry can settle it once existing shared
readers have admitted the missing reference; Inbox adds no reference-resolution loop.
Auxiliary reads cap retained results at 2,000 events / 4 MiB per stage; the shared reader
keeps its existing per-request deadline and cancellation. Missing roots,
participation or older activity can omit rows; an empty Inbox does not prove
complete history. No polling, independent row source or channel window is
opened for the feed. Access/cache/disconnect/disposal fence pending reads; local
read intent remains with unread. Packaged/native acceptance and human visual
feedback remain separate.

Reminders and their NIP-ER lifecycle are **not included** in this change.
The unfinished reminder prototype is preserved separately for later work,
not shipped in the Inbox source or broker routes. Follow/mute Inbox policy,
full backlog discovery and nonchat activity are outside this slice. Project and
approval queries, grouping, routing and detail presentation are deliberately
excluded rather than presented as partial parity. Native/ACP packaged acceptance and human visual feedback
remain open. Do not treat this as the full OG Inbox port.

## Verification status

`inbox-feed.test.ts` exercises the real session reader/visibility/unread owners
with signed ephemeral events, including the first-admission subscriber ordering,
held edit and tombstone reads, failure/retry, reentrant access removal and cache
reset, root regrouping, and an edited addressed target older than 500 ordinary
messages. `unread.test.ts` retains the current main read/catch-up behavior and
adds Inbox projection/read-state cases. Neither file establishes browser paint,
real relay persistence or packaged/native acceptance. PR4 must cover the
per-row pending/failed presentation contract and exact inline previews.


### Review repairs

Incomplete obligations now survive lifecycle changes that retain readable evidence.
Closure includes retained author edits omitted by later relay queries and fails
visibly on withheld auxiliary evidence. Shared unread remains the sole row owner;
the unused feed row copy and its 70-deletion abort were removed with explicit
approval. A prepared channel-read intent lets the dependent UI retry the original
cutoff and manual-clear keys. Tests retain all prior scenarios, distinguish both
finite retention guards, and prove 71 admitted author deletions do not resurrect
rows or require a second reconciliation buffer.

Prior local tests and review cover the repairs on the combined tree; this PR's
updated head requires its own checks. No human/live/native acceptance or shipping
readiness is claimed.
