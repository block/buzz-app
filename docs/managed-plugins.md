# Managed plugin sources

An organization, or a tool that manages a machine for it, can declare "these plugin
sources are recommended here" by writing one JSON file. Buzz reads the file and
offers the listed plugins in **Settings → Plugins**. Nothing in Buzz depends on who
writes the file.

The file only recommends. It never installs, enables, updates or removes anything.
Each plugin still goes through the Git import and its access review, and the person
using Buzz confirms every change. The desktop app reads the file; the browser build
has no native plugin storage, so the feature is absent there.

## File location

`managed-plugins.json` lives in the app data folder, next to `profiles/` and outside
the profile storage Buzz owns. Plugin storage and the policy therefore share one root,
which `BUZZODZ_HOME` moves.

| App | Identifier |
| --- | --- |
| Installed Buzz | `xyz.block.buzz.desktop` |
| Development builds (`just desktop`) | `xyz.block.buzz.desktop.dev` |

| OS | App data folder | Policy file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/<identifier>/` | `<folder>/managed-plugins.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\<identifier>\` | `<folder>\managed-plugins.json` |
| Linux | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/<identifier>/` | `<folder>/managed-plugins.json` |

Resolution order, the same one `buzzodz` uses for plugin storage:

1. `BUZZ_MANAGED_PLUGINS`, when set and non-empty, is the full path of the file. It must
   be absolute; a relative value makes the policy unusable. Use it for tests.
2. Otherwise `$BUZZODZ_HOME/managed-plugins.json`, when `BUZZODZ_HOME` is set.
3. Otherwise `managed-plugins.json` in the identifier's app data folder above.

One file serves every local profile (`BUZZODZ_PROFILE`) under that folder. A tool that
wants both an installed and a development Buzz to see the policy writes both paths.
The pre-1.0 `dev.local.buzz.foundation` folder is not read.

A missing file means no policy. Buzz never creates, edits or deletes the file; the
writer creates the folder if needed. "Sign out and erase local data" clears the whole
app data folder, including this file, so a writer should restore it on its next run.

### Writing the file safely

- Write UTF-8 JSON, at most 256 KiB, as a regular file (not a directory).
- Write a temporary file in the same folder and rename it over the target, so Buzz never
  reads a half-written file. A truncated file would be reported as unusable, then
  recovered on the next read.
- The file is advisory configuration, not a secret. Anything that can write the app
  data folder can write it, so the review dialog, not the label, is what protects the user.

## Schema (version 1)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "Example Org",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "example.notes",
      "repository": "https://github.com/example-org/buzz-plugins",
      "reference": "v1.4.0",
      "commit": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
      "path": "plugins/notes/dist"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | yes | The number `1`. Any other value makes the whole file unusable. |
| `source` | yes | Display name of the managing organization or tool, shown as "Recommended by *source*" and "Managed by *source*". 1 to 80 characters after trimming, no control characters. |
| `plugins` | yes | Array of at most 64 entries. Later entries beyond 64 are ignored. |
| `plugins[].id` | yes | The plugin manifest ID: lowercase letters, digits, dots and hyphens, starting with a letter. Not a plugin included with Buzz. |
| `plugins[].repository` | yes | An HTTPS or SSH Git URL, or GitHub `owner/repository`, as the Add dialog accepts. No credentials, query or fragment. Buzz stores the normalized HTTPS or SSH URL. |
| `plugins[].reference` | yes | A branch or tag name: letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `/`, `-`, at most 200 characters, not starting with `-`. |
| `plugins[].commit` | yes | The full 40 digit (SHA-1) or 64 digit (SHA-256) hexadecimal object ID the reference must resolve to. Matching ignores case. Abbreviated IDs are rejected. |
| `plugins[].path` | no | Relative folder of the built plugin (containing `manifest.json` and `plugin.js`, or a signed release pair) inside the repository. Default `.`. No `..`, no absolute paths. |

Unknown fields are errors, at the top level and inside entries, so a typo is reported
instead of silently ignored. A new schema revision gets a new `version`.

### What makes a file or entry invalid

- **Unusable file.** The file is not readable, not UTF-8 or JSON, larger than 256 KiB, not
  a regular file, not an object, has a wrong or missing `version`, an invalid `source`,
  a `plugins` value that is not an array, or an unknown top-level field. Buzz recommends
  nothing and shows the reason in Settings → Plugins.
- **Ignored entry.** Any entry that breaks the rules above is skipped and reported by
  position (`Plugin 2: …`) while valid entries still apply. A repeated `id` keeps the
  first entry and reports the others. At most 16 problems are reported.

Neither case crashes Buzz or blocks other plugin management.

## How Buzz compares entries with installed plugins

The pinned `commit` identifies exactly what the organization means. Buzz records the
commit it installed from a Git repository in the plugin's saved source. Plugins that
were installed before this feature have no recorded commit.

| State | Meaning | Offered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing | No plugin with this ID is installed. | **Review and install** |
| Current | Installed from the same repository at the pinned commit and path. | Marked "Managed by *source*" |
| Outdated | Installed from the same repository, but at another or an unrecorded commit or path. | **Review update**; marked "Managed by *source*" |
| Other | Installed from a folder, an unrecorded source, another repository, or included with Buzz. | A note only. Buzz does not replace it. Remove it to see the recommendation again. |

Repositories match after normalization, ignoring a trailing `/` or `.git`.

## What the person using Buzz sees

- **Settings → Plugins** shows a **Recommended by *source*** group listing Missing and
  Outdated plugins, and a note for Other ones. Each row shows the repository, reference
  and path. Installed managed plugins carry **Managed by *source*** in their row and
  details.
- **Review and install** and **Review update** open the existing import review. Buzz
  reads the repository at the pinned commit, shows the commit, and lists the plugin's
  host access. For an update it shows what changed from the installed version. Nothing
  is installed until the person chooses **Install plugin** or **Update**. A new plugin
  can be installed disabled using the same "Enable plugin" switch as any import; an
  update keeps the plugin's enabled state.
- **Pending recommendations** show as a small count beside **Plugins** in the profile
  menu and beside **Manage plugins** in Settings. There is no startup prompt or modal.
- **Disable** works as for any plugin.
- **Remove** works as for any plugin. The recommendation stays visible, so a removed
  plugin returns to the Recommended group and can be reinstalled. Buzz never removes a
  plugin because the file changed or a line was deleted; a plugin no longer listed
  simply loses its Managed by label.
- An invalid file or ignored entries are reported in the same section.

## Pinned commit behavior

The Git import resolves `reference` with a shallow clone, then requires `HEAD` to be
exactly `commit`. If the reference has moved, the review shows the two commits and
refuses to continue; there is no fallback to the new commit. Pin a tag, or rewrite the
entry's `commit` when you intend a branch to advance. Because only the reference's tip is
fetched, a commit that is no longer the tip of its reference cannot be installed.

A Git install records `commit` in the plugin's saved source in the profile registry.
Older Buzz versions reject that field and offer settings recovery, so downgrading after
a Git install is not supported, as with other registry additions.

## Refresh timing

Buzz reads the file when it starts, and again each time it refreshes the plugin
catalog, about once per second while it runs. A new or changed file therefore appears
without a restart, in Settings and in the pending counts.

## Inspecting a policy

```sh
buzzodz plugin managed
buzzodz --home /path/to/app-data plugin managed
BUZZ_MANAGED_PLUGINS=/tmp/policy.json buzzodz plugin managed
```

The command prints the file path, the source name, each valid entry with its state for
the selected profile, and the reason for each ignored entry. `buzzodz` and the desktop
share one implementation, so a writer can use it to check a file it wrote.

## Writer checklist

1. Pick the app data folder (or paths) for the identifiers you manage.
2. Build the JSON exactly as above: `version` 1, a short `source`, and for every
   plugin the ID, repository, reference, full commit and built-plugin path.
3. Write it atomically.
4. Run `buzzodz plugin managed` and confirm no entry is reported as ignored.
5. Rewrite the file only when the recommendation changes.
