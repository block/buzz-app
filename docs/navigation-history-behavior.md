# Navigation history behavior

Dialogs and content tabs follow the [navigation history and dismissal contract](navigation-history.md).
The integrated families are Members, Settings sections, provider controls opened
within Settings or through Agents-page links, and thread, Profile and GitHub tabs.

Back/Forward revisits content and restores the selected thread while retaining
open tabs. X (and the equivalent explicit tab
close controls) removes the thread and retires its addressed visits. Traversal
skips those dismissed visits; Close does not add another visit that Back undoes.
Unrelated channel/message visits remain. A cold thread closes to its own channel
in place. Explicitly opening the same thread later creates a fresh visit.
Back/Forward returns a thread to where the reader left it in this window; only
a fresh opening reveals a linked message again.

Profiles and GitHub use the same rule. Their read-only target and optional
thread context are carried as `detail` in the scoped conversation address;
Back/Forward restores selection and reload resolves the panel through the
existing registry. A new link replaces the transient Profile/GitHub detail;
opening a thread clears it. Replacement does not retire the earlier visit, so
Back/Forward can reconstruct it. Explicitly retained tabs keep their existing rules.
Replacing the live session within the same account/community reconstructs the
read-only address, including after deliberate same-community resets. Old panel
callbacks are revoked; local editors do not carry across sessions. A different
account/community scope clears the current detail address once known; a
temporarily unknown reconnect scope does not.
Thread/detail dismissal records survive same-scope session replacement, including
verified reply roots. Closing reconstructed content retires its earlier visits
as well as its current one; this does not carry layout or live panel objects.
An inactive X preserves the selected content while retiring the closed tab's
known visits. Other panel families keep their existing behavior. Navigation
does not recreate terminal sessions or change pane layout history. Close other
tabs and Close all tabs retire the complete set of closed content visits in one
navigation transaction, including inactive tabs. The kept tab stays selected;
underlying channel/message visits and other channel workspaces remain available.

Members follows the same rule: opening it adds a visit. Back closes it while
staying on the channel; Forward restores it. X, Escape and outside dismissal
retire that visit, so the next Back leaves the channel and
Forward keeps Members closed. A link handoff replaces the Members visit with
its destination when the channel opener is known; cold handoffs retain a channel
visit beneath the new destination.

Settings Close retires its known section visits for the same account/community
scope and returns to the covered workspace. Back/Forward between sections remains
reversible until Close. Profile discard confirmation precedes dismissal and Back/Forward departure.
Keep editing preserves the mounted draft and current visit; Discard changes
continues the requested traversal without retiring the Settings visit.
Agents-page provider controls retire that provider's known visits on the same
scoped Agents page, preserving other providers and page visits. Their pending-work
close protection remains in the shared Dialog. Settings → Agent setup provider
controls get a nested Settings visit: Back closes the provider while leaving
Settings open, Forward restores it, and provider Close retires only its nested
visits. Closing Settings retires its sections and nested provider visits together.
Restoration opens controls, never an install, sign-in or save operation. This does
not add new history visits to every existing confirmation or editor.

## History and lifetime boundaries

App arrows, supported history shortcuts and mouse Back/Forward use the same
navigation driver. Browsers retain their physical history entries; the driver
skips retired entries rather than claiming to delete arbitrary native history.
The app's traversal affordances account for those skipped entries. The managed
window is capped at 100 visits, including its persisted dismissal associations;
older return paths expire and their tab metadata is pruned. Dismissal
indices are kept in sessionStorage for the browser chain; open tabs themselves
retain their existing community-session lifetime. After reload the driver knows
the current visit and its immediate opener. Older visits not revisited since
reload may remain reachable after closing the same content; workspace restoration
across refresh is separate from this behavior.

## Evidence boundaries

Colocated tests cover driver traversal, inactive dismissal, cold targets, verified
thread roots and navigation-attempt lifetime. The browser regression file proves
actual popstate/hashchange traversal, X and two-tab behavior in the production
components with the existing disposable relay fixture. It does not establish
native desktop acceptance. Manual comparison and acceptance steps are recorded
in the pull request description.
