# NIP-PS: Plugin Signing

> Buzz draft. This is not an upstream standardized NIP.

NIP-PS binds a built Buzz plugin artifact to a Nostr publisher key. It uses
ordinary [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md)
event IDs and Schnorr signatures; it defines no new cryptography.

## Release files

An API v1 release is a pair of local files:

- `plugin.artifact.json`: the exact JSON bytes containing the validated plugin
  manifest and self-contained built JavaScript module.
- `plugin.signature.json`: a signed NIP-PS event.

The `x` digest covers every byte of `plugin.artifact.json` as written. It does
not hash the source directory, Git commit, or reserialized recipient copy.

## Event

The event is a regular kind `1064` event with empty `content`. It has exactly
one of each required tag, each with exactly two elements:

| Tag | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `x` | Lowercase hex SHA-256 of the exact artifact file bytes |
| `t` | `buzz-plugin-release-v1` |

For example, with placeholder IDs and hashes:

```json
{
  "id": "<NIP-01 event ID>",
  "pubkey": "<publisher hex pubkey>",
  "created_at": 0,
  "kind": 1064,
  "tags": [
    ["x", "<64 lowercase hex characters>"],
    ["t", "buzz-plugin-release-v1"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "<NIP-01 signature>"
}
```

Other tags convey no plugin authority. NIP-94 kind `1063` is not a NIP-PS
signature, and this draft defines no URL or MIME tag.

## Verification and trust

Before import and each load, verify the NIP-01 event ID and signature, kind,
empty content, required tags, and `x` against the exact artifact bytes. Parse
and validate the artifact manifest and module as usual. The publisher is only
the verified event `pubkey`, never a URL, manifest claim, or unsigned field.

An installed signed plugin may update only under the same manifest ID and
publisher key; it cannot silently downgrade to unsigned. Users decide whether
to trust a publisher. Signing does not sandbox plugin code.

The file pair can be distributed through a folder or Git repository without a
relay. Any later relay publication requires relay support for kind `1064`.
