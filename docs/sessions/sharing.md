# Sharing a live session

Sharing uses ordinary channel membership. Me placement is private client-side
organization, independent of access; see [Me and sessions](README.md).

## Current sharing behavior

Me's header, conversation-row Share action and Shared indicator, and a Messages
session's header open the same **Share session** access dialog. Share stays in the
same conversation: no metadata change, session promotion, Me removal or automatic
navigation to Messages. Name, visibility and lifetime are not recipient-sharing
controls. The separate **Convert to channel** action sits at the footer’s leading
edge and opens a visibility confirmation; empty-selection **Done** never converts.
**Copy link** copies `buzz://channel/<id>` only; its pointer/keyboard hint explains
that copying grants no access. Recipients still need independent membership.

One searchable, grouped picker offers eligible existing stream/forum channels,
then people. Select multiple people and at most one channel; removing the selected
channel makes other channels available again. Known agents are excluded from direct
people search using `session.agentChoices` and profile evidence. Unknown
classification is not proof of humanity. Direct draft selections stay visible under
**People or channel**. Confirmed shares recorded on this device appear as one
**#channel** disclosure with an **N members** subline per destination; expand to
inspect its recorded recipients who still have verified session access. Recorded
direct shares remain individual even with channel overlap. Other known agents
already in the session appear individually unless represented in a recorded channel
group. Agent classification does not imply a prior share. Unrecorded human or unclassified access stays inside a
default-closed **Other access** disclosure with a member count and no provenance
paragraph. There is no Session participants or Has access heading, nor a static Can
participate label.
Only draft selections have Remove actions; these remove a selection, never revoke existing access. The verified roster still
shows loading or failure with Retry, never treating a failed read as an empty audience.
Named identities have no routine public-key subtitle in search or selected/current
rows. The shared naming policy receives current members, draft recipients and
transient search facts. If resolved names still collide (including when the naming
plugin is disabled), only those names receive a `publicKeyLabels` qualifier. The
unnamed-key fallback remains; keys still own
selection and writes. The Share action uses a share-arrow icon distinct from the
Shared status icon. The icon describes current human access, not share history.

People gain access to the full existing history and new messages. Selecting a
channel shows **#name** with its **N members** subline, including the viewer,
in a default-closed disclosure. Expand it to inspect participants; Remove is a
separate sibling action. One strong roster read on selection supplies display
evidence, with loading/unavailable states and Retry participants instead of zero.
Profiles load on expansion. This display read is separate from the fresh frozen
audience used on submission. Once captured, the selected-channel disclosure shows
the original channel snapshot, labelled **Submitted audience**, including on
reopen. Its rows/count never switch to current destination membership during Retry;
new arrivals are not added and departed members remain in the submitted audience.
Direct selections stay separate. Start over is required to choose a new audience. Confirmed grants record the original channel snapshot separately as
device-local display history, not proof of link delivery. The grant remains a
snapshot: future joins/departures are not synchronized. **Share** grants the
union of directly selected keys and one fresh relay-confirmed destination roster,
including bots, then posts one ordinary kind-9 link without notification tags.
Its hover/focus hint explains that channel sharing grants access and posts a link; the compact **Share**
label keeps Copy link and Share together in the trailing footer group. At enlarged
text sizes, that group scrolls horizontally and focus reveals the selected action.
People-only **Share** grants access without posting or sending a DM. These
recipients use ordinary membership-based discovery; immediate recipient visibility
has not been validated across accounts. **Copy link** provides an explicit manual
handoff. A channel link opens the same session ID/history, not a copied session or
a new thread. Reopen Share to post that same session in another channel, one
channel per submission. Direct people selected alongside a channel are granted
source-session access, not destination-channel membership or a separate DM link. With no audience, **Done**
closes without writes. An empty channel audience cannot post a zero-recipient share.

The Shared indicator uses a non-cached verified current roster and positively
cached non-agent profile/agent-choice evidence for an additional human, including
another human owner. Known bot roles may exclude a member, but administration
readiness is not required: cold rendering does not refresh roles or profiles.
Unknown profiles remain unclassified; absence of the indicator is **not** a privacy
promise. The access dialog loads roles and profiles on demand, without per-row reads,
polling. Its device-local share history is display-only and does not drive the
indicator. Clicking the indicator opens that same dialog.

## Retry and operation ownership

`src/bundled/sessions/SessionShare.tsx` owns presentation using shared Dialog,
Combobox, Accordion, Avatar, Button, IconButton and Tooltip. `share-attempt.ts` retains exact
submitted intent in process per RelaySession/source ID; `share.ts` owns fresh
destination evidence, grants and link receipts. Membership authority and durable
operation IDs remain with member additions and Outbox. This sharing flow adds no
host or relay capability.

The combined audience is deduplicated and bounded to 100 distinct keys before any
grant. The fresh snapshot freezes before grants and is retained on retry, including
over-capacity evidence. An oversized snapshot sends no grants; Retry keeps that
snapshot even after destination membership changes. **Start over** is required to
capture a different audience. Confirmed grants are skipped; direct selections never
vanish when choosing a channel. Saved grant IDs, link IDs, unknown delivery, concurrent
remount guards, stale Retry/Start over guards and session lifetime fencing remain.
Partial failures distinguish confirmed access from unconfirmed link posting. Pending
buttons retain their label and block duplicate activation. The first pending share
keeps its existing footer actions: saving an in-flight receipt does not insert a
disabled **Start over** button. Recovery offers Start over after failure and keeps
that button in place, disabled, while Retry runs. Changed eligibility
shows inline access-change recovery and disables Share/Retry until access recovers. Closing a view does not
cancel submitted work; a superseded visit receives no completion navigation.

Legacy in-process submitted channel-creation/link intents retain their created ID
and exact link retry. New shares cannot create channels. Retired direct promotion
settings are not replayed. This is not an atomic grant/post transaction or a
persistent composite app-restart journal. Start over clears choices, not access or
queued operations; a deliberately new attempt may post another link.

## Explicit conversion, separate from Share

The product owner approved this distinction on 2026-10-14: **Share** keeps session
behavior and Me placement; **Convert to channel** removes the initiating viewer's
Me placement and opens the same conversation in Messages, for either Private or
Public. It changes organization and conversation behavior, never creates a new
conversation or copies history.

Share’s bottom-left footer, the Me header overflow and personal-row menu offer
**Convert to channel** for a verified standalone session. `ConvertSession.tsx`
reuses the shared Dialog, Field, Private/Public RadioGroup and Button. Private is
the default; Public warns that the community can view the full existing history.
Draft recipient selections are never granted by conversion. Conversion is disabled
while a share is pending; recover or Start over that share first. Cancel writes
nothing and returns focus to the retained initiating control.

The sequence is explicit, not atomic:

1. Read current Me preferences before admitting conversion. Confirm one signed
   kind-9002 command through the existing `channelDetails` owner. Fresh metadata,
   owner/admin authority, conflict checks, altered-signature rejection and exact
   readback remain unchanged. Clear the session marker and apply the chosen
   visibility; preserve name, lifetime and labels. Omit unchanged TTL/visibility
   and all label intent, so unrelated relabeling cannot overwrite or strand recovery.
2. Use `mePlacement.set(id, false, {signal})` to remove only this viewer's placement
   and assignment. Its existing encrypted account/community record, serialization,
   fresh revision checks, selected-head confirmation and Outbox own persistence.
   Other groups, conversations, defaults, memberships and other people's placement
   are untouched. A false `has()` during loading/error is not proof of removal.
3. After confirmed removal, announce **Converted to channel.** and open the same
   channel ID in Messages from Me. If already in Messages, retain the current
   conversation and restore focus to Channel actions. No new grant, notification,
   agent wake or transcript write occurs.

The form lives outside type-dependent Messages chrome and outside the disappearing
Me row. Replacement-composer autofocus does not steal its focus. Actual navigation,
connection replacement and unmount fence subsequent steps and late completion;
already-enqueued writes still belong to their existing durable owners. No completion
navigation is sent to a superseded visit. Navigation itself uses the host's existing
opening/error recovery, not a new relay operation.

### Partial success and removal recovery

An uncertain metadata publication offers **Check status**, never automatic resend.
The pending details owner retains exact selected visibility; **Reload session
details** recovers failed reads without losing that intent. If another details
surface confirmed the publication, fresh matching metadata can advance the retained
conversion receipt without another kind-9002 command.

`conversion.ts` retains only session-local orchestration intent and the confirmed
metadata phase, with a shared running guard. It is not permission evidence or a
new persistent transaction. After metadata success but failed/unconfirmed placement
removal, the dialog says **Channel converted. Finish removing it from Me.**
**Finish conversion** retries only the existing preference operation. Closing and
reopening from the Me menu/Share or Messages header retains that recovery. A fresh
record already omitting the ID confirms removal without another publication; an
unresolved older write stays under the existing Outbox guard and recovery.

Restart/session replacement loses the orchestration receipt, not access or the
channel. A verified ordinary channel still in the viewer's Me offers explicit
**Move to Messages** in Me's menu/Share. This removal-only action reads current
metadata and uses the same preference writer, with no metadata rewrite or inferred
conversion provenance. It also provides a deliberate way to clear older ordinary
channels retained in Me. No automatic cleanup of someone else's private filing.

### Ordinary behavior after conversion

Verified ordinary stream/forum type overrides retained Me placement in the shared
`meChat` decision. Subsequent Claude/Codex/native-runner turns use ordinary channel
reply/typing policy, even if another agent owner still has this ID in Me. Already
admitted turns retain their frozen policy; conversion does not cancel running work.
Unknown/cached type evidence does not masquerade as verified ordinary metadata.
No runtime rewrite or new agent authority is added. Old Me routes use type-correct
composer flags and ordinary recipient controls for an ordinary channel.

The same ID, history, Canvas, members, labels and lifetime remain. Messages' sidebar
continues to show verified ordinary streams during partial removal; this is channel
type evidence, not conversion provenance. Public uses the existing `visibility=open`
wire tag and does not introduce an enforceable View-only role.

## Explicitly deferred or blocked

- **Create new channel** was removed from the Share dialog for this slice.
- **Optional session naming and named newly posted links** are explicitly deferred
  to a separate PR by the human on 2026-10-13. This change adds no name field or
  named-link format; the existing Rename action and numeric link labels remain.
- **Can view / Can participate** is deferred to a second PR. Read-only requires
  relay-enforced authorization and a matching client capability contract; a
  cosmetic role switch or disabled composer is not sufficient. This slice shows
  neither a fake dropdown nor a static role tag.
- Direct-person DM/link delivery is not implemented. Access grants alone are not
  a dedicated invitation or share notification; explicit automatic handoff needs
  a separate product decision.
- Dynamic destination inheritance/revocation, synced grant provenance and removal
  permissions remain unimplemented. The approved device-local display history is
  not an authorization record or a composite restart journal. Standalone
  creation/lifetime editing is separate work in PR #1079, not a dependency of
  sharing or conversion and not a Share option.
  No provenance is inferred from links or membership.

## Device-local display history

`share-history.ts` reuses scoped view storage under
`sessions:shares:<source-id>`. It is plaintext browser/WebView local storage,
partitioned by account, community and source session, not encrypted host or relay
data. Records are bounded to 64 KiB per source, 100 channel segments and 1,000 keys
per segment/direct list. Malformed, oversized or unreadable history fails visibly
without replacing the prior record. There is no eviction or automatic repair:
a full/malformed record remains blocked for that session on this device until its
local view state is cleared (leaving the community purges it with other view
state). Later shares can still grant access and post their link. Unrecorded people
appear under **Other access**; known agents retain their individual display rule.
The warning does not promise individual direct-share provenance that was not saved.

The attempt captures the original channel roster separately from its combined
retry audience. Only confirmed grants merge into history, including partial
successes. Repeated shares to the same destination coalesce; direct choices remain
individual even when also in a channel segment. Completed grant/link operations
retire if history saving fails; the warning stays visible and Done never replays
those operations.

Recorded channel recipients/counts intersect the confirmed original-share union
with verified current source-session access, including the viewer when present.
Current destination names may update labels, but later joins/departures do not
change history or synchronize access. Selecting a recorded destination shows its
current chooser disclosure instead; source members not covered by that disclosure
remain under Other access or their recorded direct share. Failed source evidence
shows loading/retry, not an access claim. Historical or other-device provenance is
never inferred from roster overlap, links or display names.

## Required PR-description limitation note

> Sharing segments are display-only history saved on this device, partitioned by
> account and community. They survive reload/restart on this device but do not sync
> across devices and are not backfilled for earlier shares. Human/unclassified access
> without recorded provenance is grouped in the default-closed Other access
> disclosure; known session agents remain individual rows. Channel
> groups retain confirmed original-share keys filtered by current session access; they do not auto-sync destination
> membership or prove link delivery. History-saving failure never revokes access or
> replays completed grants/messages. Cross-window writes have no merge-transaction

> history is deferred.

## Validation and remaining acceptance

Mounted component/service tests cover exact signed grants, frozen retry intent,
conversion recovery and draft-settings failure/retry. Existing Chromium/WebKit
journeys exercise actual app wiring, storage reload, focus, portal containment,
scrolling and footer reachability. Exact checked snapshots, commands, counts,
failures and review outcomes live in [sharing evidence](sharing-evidence.md).
Earlier checkpoints do not establish validation of later changes.

Human confirmation of the rebased build, packaged/native GUI quit/relaunch,
live relay ACLs, cross-account discovery, no-wake behavior, hosted CI and required
reviewer approval remain separate gates. The 2026-10-14 integration checkpoint
in the evidence document records the rebase and focused checks, not shipping
acceptance. Narrow enlarged-text footer clipping/wrapping remains a presentation
limitation. Main's opaque modal fill supersedes the earlier translucent dialog
screenshots; anchored floating surfaces retain their shared treatment.
The configured desktop/Vite remain running. PR preparation performs no live share,
settings write or app restart.
