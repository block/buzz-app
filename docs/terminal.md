# Terminal plugin

In a channel, click **Terminal** in the conversation header or press **Cmd+J**
(macOS) / **Ctrl+J** (other platforms). The bottom drawer starts a login shell the
first time it opens for that community/account/channel. **Hide** and the shortcut
hide the drawer without stopping work; reopening reattaches the same emulator and
shell. **End session** explicitly terminates it; **Restart** starts a fresh shell.
An exited shell remains visible until ended/restarted and never respawns automatically.

## Run locally

From the agreed feature worktree, use `bin/just desktop`. Native commands require
a rebuilt/restarted desktop process; Vite HMR alone cannot install the PTY bridge.
Use the normal public `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` development setup from README for live
channels. Do not copy private keys into `.env.local`. Coordinate startup if another
Buzz development server already owns the port.

Local PTYs are implemented for macOS/Linux. Windows native startup reports that it
is unsupported in this slice. Browser-only Buzz hides the terminal launcher and
does not register its shortcut; there is no HTTP shell endpoint. Automated macOS native tests and browser engines do
not establish Linux or packaged desktop acceptance.

## Appearance and welcome

BuzzTerm follows the host's shared Light/Dark colors and text-size preference,
including xterm's background, text, cursor and selection. Explicit ANSI colors retain
xterm's distinct palette rather than collapsing CLI foreground/background pairs
onto shared UI roles; xterm's minimum-contrast adjustment keeps ordinary text readable.
Appearance updates the existing emulator in place, preserving shell and scrollback.
Applications that emit true-color escape sequences still select their palette;
xterm may adjust foreground lightness for contrast. The launcher and drawer use
the shared design system: Base UI-backed buttons, Tabler icons, `PanelHeader`,
named text roles and the system mono face. The drawer is a precise `data-buzz-ui`
boundary inside the otherwise legacy channel screen, not a second rounded Panel.
Xterm reads `bg-panel`, `text-primary` and the purple selection tint; its mono
size, leading and tracking follow the host's type ramp without double scaling.
The host still owns global styles, appearance and keyboard-only focus; no viewer
preferences or second reset are imported. The original rainbow remains confined
to the non-interactive welcome art, not terminal colors or ordinary controls.

The original BuzzTerm wordmark, beveled frame and honeycomb geometry appears once
per new shell, after its first output, for at most 3 seconds. Its rainbow lettering
and honeycomb use brighter pastels in light mode and adjust with the host mode. It is a static,
non-interactive overlay (also safe for reduced motion), never PTY input or
scrollback. Typing/clicking dismisses it immediately; hide/reopen does not replay
it. The artwork measures its own glyph grid and scales as a whole in shallow
drawers, independently of xterm line spacing. Narrow panels fall back to a compact
wordmark. Session actions use labeled shared icon buttons so short drawers retain
terminal rows at enlarged text sizes.

## Public shell context

At **shell creation**, Buzz supplies:

- `BUZZ_CHANNEL_ID`: exact channel UUID.
- `BUZZ_CHANNEL`: safe display name, or the UUID if the name is unsuitable for a
  shell environment (alphanumeric/space/`-_.`, 1–64 characters).
- `BUZZ_NPUB`, `BUZZ_RELAY_URL`: public viewer and credential-free WebSocket URL.
- `BUZZ_TERM_SESSION`, `BUZZ_TERM_VERSION`.
- `BUZZ_THREAD_ID` when a thread is open; otherwise the variable is absent.

Changing threads/channels never injects commands into an existing shell. Its toolbar
retains the context it was created with; **Restart** captures the current displayed
context. Different community/account/channel scopes do not reuse one another's shell.
Navigation hides old work, while plugin disable/replacement and app shutdown terminate
all sessions owned by that plugin lifetime.

The native spawn clears inherited environment first and rebuilds a small allowlist,
sets a standard system PATH, and runs the user's login shell so their startup files
can add their tools. Buzz private keys, auth tags, arbitrary parent credentials and
its Hermit build PATH are not inherited. This is **not a sandbox** against your shell
startup files or commands you choose to execute, and it does not authenticate the
Buzz CLI on your behalf.

## Ownership and bounds

Terminal UI/emulation and retained session controllers are plugin-owned. Native
owner UUIDs fence late spawns after disposal; they are lifecycle identities, not an
untrusted-plugin security boundary. All plugins remain trusted same-process code.

The native registry caps 20 sessions and 32 owners. Reads/flushes process at most
64 KiB per call; queued native input is capped at 1 MiB. The frontend bounds pending
input to 1 MiB, serializes reads (including hidden sessions), waits for emulator
parsing, and retains at most 5,000 scrollback lines. PTY dimensions are bounded at
2–500 columns and 1–300 rows. Native `exited` requires both final-output EOF and
child exit; final output is rendered before native cleanup.

Unix cleanup targets the shell group and its current foreground job, drains during
termination, escalates after a grace period, and reaps the leader. Explicitly detached
processes and arbitrary background job-control groups are not a process sandbox;
see native source for the exact termination boundary. Failed cleanup retains its
handle for retry.

## Verification and remaining acceptance

Focused coverage lives in `src/bundled/terminal/sessions.test.ts`, the channel/panel
composition tests, `src-tauri/src/terminal/tests.rs`, and the two
`tests/browser/terminal*.spec.mjs` journeys. The separate renderer journey exercises
real xterm input/Ctrl+C, resize, alternate-screen restoration, detach/reopen and
app-chord release without starting a shell. The channel journey exercises actual
browser launcher/shortcut absence, including plugin disable/re-enable. Desktop
registration is covered by `src/bundled/terminal/index.test.ts`; the actual desktop
header/dispatcher journey remains an attended acceptance check. Native tests exercise real PTYs,
public-context/environment fencing, limits, final output and teardown.

Before shipping, exercise the real desktop integration: open a channel terminal,
inspect only public BUZZ variables, type a command, use Ctrl+C/full-screen tools,
resize, hide/reopen, change channel/thread, restart/end, and disable Terminal in
Settings. Broad CI, packaged desktop acceptance and other operating systems are
separate from the **ready-to-try** development handoff.
