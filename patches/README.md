# Virtua 0.51.0 scroll correction boundaries

The application imports the React ESM entry (`virtua` → `lib/index.js`) from
`src/features/messages/ChannelTimeline.tsx`. Only that entry's element scroller is
patched; CommonJS, window scrolling, and other-framework exports are untouched.
Keep the dependency pinned to 0.51.0 and review the patch plus version-coupled
installed-bundle tests before upgrading or adding a different import.

## Fractional end offsets

Text layout can produce fractional row heights. WebKit can truncate an absolute
scroll offset before clamping it, leaving the final row partly outside the
viewport even when Virtua requests the end of the list. A focused notification
target then correctly remains unread under the full-row visibility policy.

The element driver rounds end-boundary targets upward before RTL normalization,
for both imperative scrolling and automatic resize compensation. The browser
clamps that target to its actual scroll range. Interior reading offsets remain
fractional, and the existing scheduling, focus and dwell rules are unchanged.
Installed-driver regressions cover both entry points and RTL; a browser regression
sets a fractional list height explicitly and requires the final row to be fully
visible without a pixel tolerance.

## Buffer while the scroll direction is frozen

Virtua renders `bufferSize` only ahead of the scroll direction, and updates that
direction only during native scrolling. A shift (prepended history) or imperative
scroll freezes it until the 150ms inferred idle. Continuous trackpad flicks can
keep it frozen: a downward flick after an upward prepend renders no rows below the
viewport, and React commits one frame behind, so the leading edge stays blank for
the rest of the gesture. The range therefore buffers both sides while the
direction is frozen, as it already does when idle. Native directional buffering
is unchanged, and the extra buffer is no larger than the idle buffer.

A shift otherwise counts every row resize as an anchoring correction. Rows wholly
below the viewport are excluded, so a newly buffered row there that resizes (a
video loading, say) cannot move the reading position. Rows above and in the
viewport, including prepended history, are still corrected.

In an isolated WKWebView over real channel history (images, video, live relay),
fast alternating flicks were measured per frame. In two instrumented runs, all 46
DOM-coverage gap frames moved downward while shift mode held an upward direction.
Stock showed 3–96 gap frames per run over ten runs; the patch showed none in six.
Short main-thread stalls and image decode dips remain.

## Failure and chosen boundary

In a system WKWebView, native momentum can overwrite an instant programmatic
scroll correction. An isolated reproduction adapted from
[WebKit 262287](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262287) sustains missing
pixels even after DOM geometry covers the viewport. The same failure reproduces
with the production ChannelTimeline and fixed messages when history is prepended.
This does not attribute every disappearing-content incident to this mechanism.

The previous Mac deferred-store/extent patch is **superseded**. A pause in native
momentum can outlast Virtua's 150ms inferred-idle timer: the deferred correction
then runs before native momentum actually ends, and the timeline stays blank.
One of two paused draft trials failed; this was timing-dependent, not a
universally failing sequence. Increasing an idle timeout is not the remedy.

Instead, at each **nonzero automatic correction** on Mac WebKit:

1. Temporarily set only the corrected overflow axis to `hidden !important`.
2. Apply Virtua's original relative correction or absolute edge target.
3. Restore the prior declaration value and priority in the next task.

This extends the mechanism already used by
[Virtua's iOS driver](https://github.com/inokawa/virtua/blob/0.51.0/src/core/driver.ts#L203-L248),
without changing the iOS branch. Overlapping interventions cancel/restore their
predecessor before capturing the original declaration. Disposal restores
immediately; an observably changed later declaration is not overwritten.

**Tradeoff:** a correction can stop the remaining trackpad coast. Several size
corrections can therefore reduce inertial travel more than one prepend. A fresh
gesture must continue to work; sustained real-history/media acceptance must assess
whether repeated braking is acceptable. No wheel ownership, permanent scrolling
CSS, forced layout, alternate store sizing, or new scroll scheduler is introduced.

The `overflow-y: hidden` frame also removes a classic, space-taking scrollbar.
Every scroller driven by the patched Virtualizer on Mac WebKit must therefore
keep a constant inline size across the toggle (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`, as
`.feed` in `src/features/messages/Messages.module.css` does). Otherwise the wider
content box re-wraps rows above the viewport, their new heights become the next
nonzero correction, and the interrupt feeds itself until the scroller oscillates
between two wrap widths.

The momentum-interruption predicate requires MacIntel and Apple vendor, excluding
Virtua's iOS detector (including desktop-mode iPad). Chrome/Firefox, non-Mac WebKit
and iOS keep existing momentum policy. Store/layout timing and imperative smooth/instant target calculation remain stock.
The cancellation boundary below retires superseded targets. Scheduler-driven
reveal/restore/bottom navigation is a
separate acceptance path, not implicitly repaired by the automatic-correction fix.
Native reveal controls showed one/two transient blank interior source frames
before immediate recovery, despite valid sampled DOM coverage. This remaining
imperative-path flicker is not the sustained automatic-correction failure; the
patch does not claim to fix it.
The stale source-map directive is removed because the generated map is unpatched.

## Newer reader input cancels retained navigation

Virtua retains imperative targets for late measurements for 150 ms. After a jump
to latest, new upward input could detach the reader, but a row measurement inside
that window replayed the old target and pulled them back down. The element driver
now invokes its existing cancellation closure on wheel, touchmove, keydown and
pointerdown, matching ChannelTimeline's reader-intent events. Capture listeners
retire the old command before a descendant handler can issue new navigation;
no input is prevented and automatic resize compensation is unchanged. Disposal
also cancels retained work and removes the listeners.

Installed-driver tests keep the clock inside the pending command's lifetime,
including a replay already queued as a microtask, and verify a fresh navigation
still responds to measurements. The browser navigation case exercises real wheel
input and late row growth, asserting position as well as arrival count. These are
not native momentum/compositor acceptance, and do not change the limits above.

The element scroller also returns its existing cancel function and the
`Virtualizer` handle exposes it as `cancelScrollToIndex`, declared in the React
typings. `ChannelTimeline` calls it from its reader-gesture handler alongside its
own intent counter. Window scrolling, prepend cancellation and the loop's timing
are unchanged. The installed-driver regression shows a size update re-applying
the target until the explicit cancel runs and never afterwards.

## Corrections after a browser clamp

When rows above the viewport shrink, the automatic correction moves the offset
by the same amount. Stock Virtua applies it relatively unless the target reaches
the end, but the layout that `scrollBy` forces clamps an offset beyond the new
end first, so the shrink lands twice: once from the clamp, once from the
correction. WebKit reports an integer `scrollTop`, which reads up to 1px short
of a fractional end, so a reader at the bottom missed the end test there while
Chromium's fractional offset met it.

The element driver takes the absolute path when the target lies within 1px of
the end, rounding outward as before, and when the last observed offset lies
more than 1px beyond the new end, scrolling to the exact target. Interior
corrections, growth and prepend shifts stay relative. The installed-driver
regressions clamp the fake viewport like a browser and cover an integer offset
at a fractional end and a shrink larger than the reader's gap to the end.
`ChannelTimeline` treats an upward offset that arrives with a shrink as reader
input only after a gesture; while following, it re-pins the bottom instead of
demoting to Jump-to-latest.

## Automated checks

```sh
bin/pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
bin/pnpm typecheck
bin/pnpm exec vitest run src/features/messages/virtua-compensation.test.mjs \
  src/features/messages/ChannelTimeline.test.tsx
bin/pnpm test:browser history-loading.spec.mjs image-scroll.spec.mjs initial-position.spec.mjs \
  --project chromium --project webkit --no-deps --workers=1
```

The driver/store/observer contracts evaluate the installed React ESM, not a
copied implementation. They cover active and inferred-idle corrections, zero
jumps, positive/negative measurements, absolute edges, horizontal RTL, overlapping
restoration, CSS priority, disposal/remount, later declarations, platform controls,
and unchanged imperative instant/smooth calls. Copied-bundle mutation controls
must fail when the production invocation, overlap/dispose restoration, priority,
or iPad exclusion is removed, or an inferred-scrolling gate is introduced.
These tests use a fake viewport; they cannot establish native painted pixels.

## Native acceptance and limits

Use an isolated system WKWebView, fixed data, no live identity, and phase-bearing
native wheel/momentum input confined to that window. Freeze/hash the source,
installed bundle and runner before each run. Start with a settled production
ChannelTimeline, prepend during momentum, then repeat with a pause longer than
150ms before the final momentum event. Compare stock, the superseded draft, and
the replacement. Capture source video frames separately from DOM/anchor traces.

Require both painted content and the correct identified reading anchor. Repeat
with a fresh reversed gesture, a second prepend at the bottom, a fresh upward
gesture, positive/negative row measurement changes, and explicitly gated local
images. Check restoration and continued movement, not just final scrollTop.
Exercise imperative reveal/restore/bottom controls separately. A pending image
placeholder and bottom rubberband/fractional edge gaps are not missing tiles.

Observed on macOS 26.6.2: stock and a paused old-draft trial sustain blank message
pixels; the replacement preserves content and correction anchors in the matched
native trials. Repeated native gestures and local images continue to paint, with
the braking tradeoff above. Ordinary Chromium/WebKit browser history, image and
initial-position journeys provide additional behavioral coverage, **not equivalent
native momentum/compositor evidence**.

The fixed-data native fixture does not fetch real older history. Three-second
movies are not four seconds of pixel evidence just because DOM traces run longer;
movie and JavaScript clocks are not synchronized. These bounded results are not
signed-package/cross-platform acceptance or verification of the original user's
sustained real-message incident. Keep the change draft until that acceptance is
completed; do not restart a running app without coordination.


## Base UI 1.8.0: native choice reset

`@base-ui__react@1.8.0.patch` adds native form-reset listeners to Checkbox.Root
and Radio.Root, with RadioGroup supplying its existing state reset, in their
shipped ESM and CommonJS modules. Without it, resetting
an uncontrolled choice restores the hidden native input but leaves Base UI's
visible checked state unchanged. The shared Buzz wrappers continue to delegate
choice state, keyboard handling and form participation to Base UI.

The listeners run in the next task, after native reset and ancestor cancellation;
a microtask can run before the browser completes its default reset action. Each actual
input owns its `form` binding, including external `form=` associations, disabled
radios and radios mounted after their group. Cleanup prevents queued work after
unmount. The group retains its existing uncontrolled state setter; repeated
radio notifications are idempotent. Controlled values remain with the caller,
and each hidden input restores its current checked state if the owner leaves
that value unchanged. Stable callbacks read the latest values when the owner
updates them during reset. No synthetic change event or ordinary change callback
is emitted. No other primitives are patched.

Remove the patch when a pinned Base UI release passes the reset regressions in
`src/shared/design-system/ui/controls.test.tsx` and the design viewer's native
reset browser check without it. A frozen install must reproduce the patch:

```sh
bin/pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
bin/pnpm exec vitest run src/shared/design-system/ui/controls.test.tsx
bin/pnpm design:test:browser
```
