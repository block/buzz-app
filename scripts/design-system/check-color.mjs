/**
 * Colour-system guard.
 *
 * One rule, and it exists because of a specific near-miss: the accent tint
 * looked right in light mode at Tailwind's `purple-100`, but its dark
 * counterpart looked oversaturated, and the obvious fix was to write
 * `purple-950/50` — dim a too-strong colour until it looks subtle.
 *
 * That value was not wrong. `purple-950/50` composites to roughly the same
 * muted deep purple the palette now holds as a step, and two independent
 * attempts landed within a few percent of it. The problem is where it lives: an
 * opacity expression inside a component is a colour decision with no name, no
 * light/dark pair, and no way for the contrast guard to measure it.
 *
 * So the rule is not "never use opacity". It is: **opacity is not how you reach
 * a lighter or subtler colour.** If a step is missing, add it to the palette —
 * that is a reviewed diff instead of a value buried in a class list.
 *
 * Genuine translucency, where something behind must show through, is a
 * different axis and has its own tokens: `glass-*`, and the `--texture-*` and
 * shadow values that bake alpha into a literal.
 *
 * It also audits the layering itself: that the palette is the only place a
 * literal lives, that an identity role references a palette step rather than
 * holding its own value, and that two roles doing the same job resolve to the
 * same step rather than merely to the same value today. That last one is not
 * hypothetical — `accent-2` and `tint-purple` were the same purple in light mode
 * and two different purples in dark, and nothing caught it because both were
 * hand-picked.
 *
 * Run: pnpm check:color
