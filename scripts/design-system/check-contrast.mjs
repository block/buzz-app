/**
 * Fails the build when a text role cannot be read on a surface it is used on.
 *
 * This exists because the token table found four broken pairings by rendering
 * them, and a defect found by looking is a defect that ships until someone
 * looks. The table stays as the readable view; this is the check that runs.
 *
 * It parses `tokens.css` rather than a duplicate list of values, so it cannot
 * drift from the system it audits: resolve each role through its `var()` chain
 * to a literal, per mode, then measure every pairing the roles allow.
 *
 * Judged with APCA, per DESIGN.md § Contrast. The WCAG 2 ratio is reported for
 * context and never decides — it is the standard that calls #8f8f8f on #1c1c1c
 * a pass at 5.27:1 while APCA scores it Lc 40.
