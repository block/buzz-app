/**
 * Type-system guard.
 *
 * Four rules from DESIGN.md § Type, enforced rather than trusted. Each one has
 * already cost the existing client real work:
 *
 *   1. No arbitrary text sizes — `text-[15px]`, `text-[0.9rem]`, `font-size:`.
 *      Fixed px froze against keyboard zoom and shipped a message-timeline
 *      regression; arbitrary rem re-fragments the scale we just consolidated.
 *   2. No `uppercase` / `tracking-*` utilities. All-caps labels are less legible
 *      and read as enterprise chrome, and tracking is corrected per ramp step.
 *   3. No size role paired with a leading utility. A role carries its own line
 *      height; overriding it is how two identical labels drift apart.
 *   4. No weight outside 400 and 600. `font-semibold` is bold.
 *
 * What this guard is for: an agent building a screen has no reason to prefer
 * `font-medium` over `font-semibold`, so left unguided it picks either, and the
 * product ends up with four weights that mean nothing. The guard removes the
 * choice where there is no judgement to apply.
 *
 * What it is NOT for: stopping a designer. Every rule has a named override with
 * a reason, and adding one is a normal edit — not an escalation. A guard that
 * blocks real work gets deleted; a guard that asks you to say why does not.
 *
 * Run: pnpm check:type
