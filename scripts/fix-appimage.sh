# fix-appimage.sh — Remove infra libs from a Tauri-produced AppImage that crash
# on Mesa 25+ / GLib 2.88 distros (Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 42+, etc.).
#
# Usage: fix-appimage.sh <path-to.AppImage>
#
# Set APPIMAGETOOL_RUNTIME_FILE to a pre-downloaded AppImage type2 runtime to
# avoid appimagetool fetching one from its mutable `continuous` tag (CI pins
# this; required for candidate builds).
#
# Root cause — three interlocking failures (upstream: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/15665):
#
#  1. EGL crash: linuxdeploy bundles libwayland-client.so.0 (1.22) alongside
#     the app. Mesa 25's libEGL calls the bundled version at runtime; the version
#     skew causes eglGetDisplay to return EGL_BAD_PARAMETER under Wayland, which
#     WebKitWebProcess treats as fatal and aborts before the window ever appears.
#
#  2. GStreamer crash: linuxdeploy's compiled AppRun.wrapped force-sets
#     GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0 to $APPDIR/usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0 -- a dir the
#     bundler never populates (bundleMediaFramework is off, and we strip the
#     bundled libgst* core below to use the host's). Crucially, once that variable
#     is set it *replaces* GStreamer's compiled-in default search path rather than
#     adding to it, so the app finds ZERO plugins on every distro:
#     "GStreamer element appsink not found" kills the WebKitWebProcess and the
#     window never paints. An earlier revision of this script hid the failure on
#     Debian only by symlinking usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0 to the Debian multiarch dir
#     (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0); that symlink dangles on Arch and
#     Fedora, and the "safe fallback to default discovery" it assumed does not
#     exist -- a set GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0 disables the default. A broken run
#     also poisons ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.x86_64.bin.
#
#  3. WebKit helper mismatch (latent): the bundled WebKit helpers
#     (WebKitNetworkProcess/WebKitWebProcess) have RUNPATH=$ORIGIN only, and
#     linuxdeploy string-patches /usr -> ././ inside libwebkit2gtk so the helper
#     dir is resolved relative to the process cwd. AppRun's chdir($APPDIR/usr)
#     makes this work; any launch that bypasses AppRun (extracted-AppDir usage,
#     repack workflows, dbus/systemd activation with cwd=/) resolves the helpers
#     wrong -- spawning nothing, dying on unresolved bundled libs, or spawning
#     the system helpers -- and the window never appears.
#
# Fix: (a) remove the offending libs so the app uses the system copies (newer and
# ABI-compatible on any distro shipping glib >= 2.72 / Ubuntu 22.04+), and
# (b) install a launcher shim in front of the app binary that strips the
# bundle-pointing GST_PLUGIN_* overrides AppRun.wrapped injects, letting the host
# GStreamer resolve plugins via its own default path (correct on Debian, Arch, and
# Fedora alike). The shim has to run *after* AppRun.wrapped: the wrapper rewrites
# the variable last -- after every apprun-hook -- so any value set before it is
# discarded (verified empirically; a runtime GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0 passed
# into the AppImage does not survive). No tauri.conf.json knob can do this --
# bundle.linux.appimage only exposes bundleMediaFramework, files (copy-only, no
# remove/symlink), and bundleXdgOpen.
