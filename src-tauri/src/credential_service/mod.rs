//! The local credential provider (block/buzz `docs/local-credential-provider.md`):
//! a process the app launches for an agent, such as `buzz` run by a harness,
//! acts as that agent without its key. The key and sign-in session stay here.
//!
//! - A harness spawn gets a fresh 256-bit token in `BUZZ_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER`,
//!   never written to disk. It acts for nobody until the runtime binds it to
//!   the agent the process serves, once; a spare process is bound when taken.
//! - The token dies with its process, and stops acting once its agent is
//!   deleted or the owner signs out or changes account: each request rechecks
//!   the agent's incarnation from binding time and the owner's retirements from
//!   issue time, on arrival and again before its result is returned.
//! - Every signature passes the contract's operation policy ([`policy`]).
//!   Sensitive kinds are refused (`denied`): there is no approval prompt.
//! - It binds only `127.0.0.1`. `Host` must name the bound address, a request
//!   that sends `Origin` (a web page) is refused, and nothing is logged.
//! - Windows has no transport in version 1, so no token is issued there.
