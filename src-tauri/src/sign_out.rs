//! Sign out of Buzz. The command only records intent in a marker outside app

//! its key (and, for a wipe, the lock every Buzz shares), does every deletion before any window, service or identity read:
//! agent keys (when asked), the wipe, then the human key. Each step is safe to
//! repeat; any failure keeps the marker and Buzz exits, so the next launch retries.
//! An erase also waits for every agent's supervisor to let go of its ownership lock.
//! Finishing first advances a record beside the marker that is never removed, so
//! a running copy can tell a sign-out finished while it let go of its locks.
