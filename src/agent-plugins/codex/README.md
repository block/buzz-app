# Codex for Agents2

An installable desktop plugin using the native process host introduced in #731.
Agents2 owns the identity, admission, configuration, and signed Buzz actions. This plugin
owns Codex work after delivery handover. It starts one `codex app-server` per agent
and uses independent Codex threads for Buzz conversations.

## Try it

From the feature worktree:

```sh
source bin/activate-hermit
bin/pnpm plugin:codex
BUZZODZ_PROFILE=codex-agents2 BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER= bin/just desktop
```

1. Open **Settings → Plugins → Load from folder**. Choose this worktree's
   `dist-plugins/codex`, install it, and turn it on. Rebuild and import that folder
   again after plugin source changes; frontend hot reload does not update an
   installed plugin.
2. Open **Agents2 → New agent**, choose **Codex**, and create an agent. The Codex
   tab checks the installed CLI and existing account. If needed, install Codex
   and run `codex login` in a terminal, then click **Check again**.
3. In the agent's **Settings** tab, set an absolute **Workspace** path. A
   disposable directory is useful for the first test. Choose model, thinking,
   session scope, and instructions, then **Save**.
4. Mentions and replies are automatic; **Attention** also lets you add event
   watches. In a channel you can write to, select the agent from the `@` picker
   and add it to the channel if prompted. Send: `@Codex Test create hello.txt containing
   hello in the workspace, read it back, and report what you found`. Use the
   agent's actual name. Expect one reply from that agent in the originating
   thread and the file in your workspace.
5. Reply in the same thread: `@Codex Test read hello.txt and remind me what you
   wrote`. Expect the same Codex session and correct file contents.

While work is active, new mentions steer it, incorporating the follow-up into the
ongoing task. Messages arriving during startup wait for the turn to start and
then steer it; idle conversations continue the saved session. If a turn finishes
while a follow-up is being delivered, the follow-up starts another turn.
By default, Buzz tools reply to the latest accepted steering message. The agent can also choose another thread or channel with tool arguments.

There are no special chat commands. Asking the agent to stop is a steering request
that Codex interprets. Disabling the plugin ends its processes. For settings,
change instructions to require a marker, save, and send another mention after the
current turn finishes. Expect the marker.

Thread scope is the default. Channel scope shares a session across channel
threads; DMs always share a conversation. Workspace changes start a fresh session.
Bindings persist locally under the community and agent identity. Earlier bindings without dynamic tools are ignored; new conversations start fresh. Switching
communities, removing an agent, or disabling the plugin ends its server.
If a saved Codex thread no longer exists, the next mention starts a fresh one.

The `buzz` dynamic-tool namespace exposes the same handlers as the Claude plugin:
`send`, `edit`, `react`, `read`, `channels`, `members`, `users`, `dm`, `mem_get`,
`mem_set`, and `canvas`. These run inside Buzz through the agent's native-backed
handle; no MCP process or Buzz credentials go to Codex. Shared file tools use the
workspace where the turn started, through the declared `base64` reader. Memory
reads use the owner's encrypted-memory view; writes use the agent handle.

To test these locally, ask the agent to read its thread, react to your message,
remember a fact under `mem/test`, recall it in a follow-up, and send an image from
the workspace. Expect agent-signed actions, correct thread routing, and one final
reply. During a long task, send a new mention and confirm it incorporates the
follow-up before its final reply.

## Checks

```sh
bin/pnpm exec vitest run src/agent-plugins/codex
bin/node src/agent-plugins/codex/live.mjs
```

The opt-in live check uses the installed Codex CLI/account in a disposable
workspace and a simulated relay. It sends no Buzz messages. It checks native shell
and file tools, the native coding prompt, conversation context, default steering,
idle follow-ups, process shutdown, saved-thread reuse, changed and cleared
instructions, missing-thread recovery, and disabled inherited MCP tools. It also
checks real dynamic Buzz callbacks, memory, workspace file uploads, and normal
final sends without aborted-turn markers. Set
`BUZZ_CODEX_TEST_MODEL` to another available model if needed. It prints only
sanitized outcomes; it does not save raw protocol or session logs.

Automated component tests cover model/effort choices, unavailable saved choices,
workspace validation, pending saves, and closing a process returned after unmount.
Protocol tests cover chunking, request correlation, interactive request rejection,
malformed output, and consumer exception containment. Runtime tests cover
conversation routing, ordinary message delivery, persistence, defaults, failures,
and cleanup.

## Limits and boundaries

- Only the owner's events start work. Event watches support those events; timers
  are unsupported and report an error.
- Replies use Agents2's host signer. Codex receives no Buzz agent key and does not
  publish through the Buzz CLI. Short Buzz guidance and custom instructions are
  supplied as developer instructions, preserving Codex’s native coding prompt.
- Codex uses workspace-write with no network access and approval policy `never`.
  Web search, inherited MCP servers, Apps, and plugins are disabled. The declared
  native process grant itself has full user access; the Codex sandbox governs its tools.
- Shared Agent Activity integration is deferred because this Agents2 delivery
  contract has no live-activity API. The Codex tab shows conversation status and
  the latest command/output. Messages and uploads use the shared Buzz tools. Codex assistant text is not automatically posted. After `buzz.send` with `final: true`, Codex finishes normally and consumes pending steering. Final sends preserve background processes, such as a dev server it started.
- Turns have a 29-minute deadline;
  RPC acknowledgements have a 30-second deadline. Local bindings retain 200 sessions.
- Uses experimental app-server APIs for dynamic tools, model discovery, application context, and terminal
  cleanup. The live check was exercised with `codex-cli 0.162.0` on macOS.
- Linux and Windows native behavior, packaged app behavior, full relay signing,
  and human acceptance require separate validation. A forced native kill can
  depend on the platform's descendant-cleanup support; this plugin adds no host
  process implementation.

Keep the PR in draft until the agent and human exercise the native mention/reply
flow, including signer behavior and process shutdown. Do not add
`buzz-review-completed` before the repository's review checklist holds.
