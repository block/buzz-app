# Bestie

Bestie is the account-saved agent pinned in Buzz's left navigation. The
selection is the private `main-agent` record shared with Solo's default-agent
owner; this plugin adds presentation and a conversation destination, not another
selection store.

## Getting started

### Pinned conversation

When the account has a saved eligible Bestie, the sidebar row adopts that
agent's name and avatar and opens their canonical direct message. The canonical
conversation is the newest verified, unarchived, non-cached DM whose roster
contains the viewer and exactly that one other public key. A Solo chat, group DM,
namesake, unknown roster or archived/cached channel never qualifies. If no exact
DM exists, the page asks the shared direct-message service to open one after
rechecking that the agent remains selectable. If agent discovery fails, an
already-verified exact DM stays usable; opening a missing one still requires a
selectable agent. Known-archived agents and agents confirmed absent from a complete
inventory do not keep a pinned conversation.

The page uses the ordinary conversation owners for history, drafts, sending,
threads and unread state. Thread visits bind to their originating DM. Restoring
one after the Bestie or canonical DM changes retires incompatible thread visits
and shows the current Bestie's chat; it never reads an old thread in the new DM.
While that exact DM is promoted, Messages omits its
ordinary row and clears any old device-local hidden-DM intent. Replacing or
deleting the Bestie, disabling the plugin, changing communities, or losing the
exact roster match releases the promotion and restores the ordinary DM row.

The pinned row and Search Buzz destination show the agent's name and avatar.
Search adds **Bestie** as supporting text and matches either name, so the pinned
DM remains recognizable without presenting a placeholder identity. Agent rows
remain separate **New chat** actions; namesakes stay distinct by exact public key
and use readable owner labels before abbreviated-key fallbacks.

### The Bestie tab

The agent you made your Bestie (with **Make my bestie** in Agents) gets a
**Bestie** tab on its agent page while it runs on this device. **Change** picks
another agent and asks before replacing your Bestie.

**Remembers you** adds memory rules to the agent's instructions, in a section
marked `<!-- buzz:bestie/memory v1 -->` … `<!-- /buzz:bestie/memory -->`, and
turning it off removes that section. The switch is on while the section is
there, whatever you edit inside it or type next to its markers. Off removes
it with your edits inside it, and keeps text you put before its opening
marker or after its closing one. If you edit, remove or copy one of its
markers, the row says the section was edited instead of showing a switch, so
it never adds a second one. **Restore** puts back the original section in
place of its two markers and what lies between them, when they still show
where it starts and ends; otherwise fix its markers in Instructions. Off
deletes no memory, and the agent's core memory is still in every prompt;
clear memory in the Memory tab.

**Private channels Bestie can read** lists the private channels you share with
Bestie, each with **Remove**. **Add to a channel** (**Choose…**) and **Add to
all my private channels** add it to the private channels you are in, most
recently active first; each channel's members see that you added it. Each
action has a row of its own, so in a narrow panel its button wraps under it.
Until your channel list has loaded in full, the section says so instead of
saying Bestie is in none: a failed read offers **Retry**, the channels already
known keep their rows, and **Add to all** waits for the full list.
Public channels
need nothing: agents read them already. Check-ins and adding Bestie to new
channels you create are not set up yet.

### Hosted setup fallback

The account choice is read before the page decides what to show. With a saved
Bestie, reconnecting, inventory failures and missing-agent states remain on the
pinned destination with their own recovery; they never fall through to setup.
Only a successful account read with no saved Bestie shows Riley's existing
Builderlab setup. A failed read remains on the Bestie page with Retry. Setup
creates a hosted agent, gives it the instructions in `prompt.ts`, creates its
private Solo home and sends the introduction.

Builderlab setup does **not** yet write that agent to `main-agent` or hand off to
the canonical DM. Connecting hosted setup to the shared selection owner is a
separate follow-up; until then, setup and an explicitly account-saved Bestie are
parallel entry paths.

### Changing hosted Bestie's instructions

When `prompt.ts` differs from the instructions on a set-up hosted Bestie, the
setup page offers **Update Bestie's instructions**. **Bestie's instructions** on
that page shows the current text.
