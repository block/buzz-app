# Bestie

Bestie is the account-saved agent pinned in Buzz's left navigation. The
selection is the private `main-agent` record shared with Solo's default-agent
owner; this plugin adds presentation and a conversation destination, not another
selection store.

## Getting started

### Pinned conversation

When the account has a saved eligible Bestie, the sidebar row adopts that
agent's name and avatar and opens their canonical direct message. The canonical
conversation is the newest verified, unarchived, non-cached DM whose roster
contains the viewer and exactly that one other public key. A Solo chat, group DM,
namesake, unknown roster or archived/cached channel never qualifies. If no exact
DM exists, the page asks the shared direct-message service to open one after
rechecking that the agent remains selectable.

The page uses the ordinary conversation owners for history, drafts, sending,
threads and unread state. While that exact DM is promoted, Messages omits its
ordinary row and clears any old device-local hidden-DM intent. Replacing or
deleting the Bestie, disabling the plugin, changing communities, or losing the
exact roster match releases the promotion and restores the ordinary DM row.

The pinned row and Search Buzz destination show the agent's name and avatar.
Search adds **Bestie** as supporting text and matches either name, so the pinned
DM remains recognizable without presenting a placeholder identity. Agent rows
remain separate **New chat** actions; namesakes stay distinct by exact public key
and use readable owner labels before abbreviated-key fallbacks.

### The Bestie tab

The agent you made your Bestie (with **Make my bestie** in Agents) gets a
**Bestie** tab on its agent page while it runs on this device. **Change** picks
another agent and asks before replacing your Bestie. Only agents on this device
can be your Bestie for now, in Change, in **Make my bestie** and in **Make my
Bestie again**: a remote one isn't set up for it yet. **Remove as Bestie** asks,
then saves no Bestie to your account: the agent stays, its check-ins stop, and
its memory section and private channels stay, which its Former Bestie tab can
turn off.

**Remembers you** adds memory rules to the agent's instructions, in a section
marked `<!-- buzz:bestie/memory v1 -->` … `<!-- /buzz:bestie/memory -->`, and
turning it off removes that section. The switch is on while the section is
there, whatever you edit inside it or type next to its markers. Off removes
it with your edits inside it, and keeps text you put before its opening
marker or after its closing one. If you edit, remove or copy one of its
markers, the row says the section was edited instead of showing a switch, so
it never adds a second one. **Restore** puts back the original section in
place of its two markers and what lies between them, when they still show
where it starts and ends; otherwise fix its markers in Instructions. Off
deletes no memory, and the agent's core memory is still in every prompt;
clear memory in the Memory tab.

**Private channels Bestie can read** lists the private channels you share with
Bestie, each with **Remove**. **Add to a channel** (**Choose…**) and **Add to
all my private channels** add it to the private channels you are in, most
recently active first; each channel's members see that you added it. Each
action has a row of its own, so in a narrow panel its button wraps under it.
Public channels need nothing: agents read them already. Adding Bestie to new
channels you create is not set up yet.

**Check-ins → Every hour** needs Remembers you, and turning memory off turns it
off too. On adds the `buzz:bestie/checkin.hourly` Hourly upkeep section to the
instructions and an hourly Attention timer, `watch/bestie-hourly-check-in`,
that wakes Bestie in your DM with it; it also turns on the agent's Attention,
which the Watching tab shows. Off removes the section and the timer and leaves
Attention on, since the agent's other watches may need it. The timer runs while
Buzz is open and the Watching plugin is on: this plugin doesn't call
`controlAttention()`, so turning Watching off still turns Attention off for
every agent. While the timer can't run, the row says it is paused. After a
sleep it runs once, not once for each missed hour. Each
check-in is a feature in `features.ts`, so another kind is one more entry.

**Changing your Bestie.** Only your Bestie checks in: whenever the saved Bestie
is known, on this device or synced from another, any other agent here has its
check-ins removed. Once your account is read to have no Bestie, saved as none
or never saved, every agent here has them removed; while it is being read, or
can't be, nothing is. Its memory section and channels stay. An agent this
device makes Bestie starts with Remembers you on; a choice synced from
elsewhere changes nothing, so memory turned off stays off. A former Bestie
keeps a **Former Bestie** tab while it has a Bestie section, or, if this device
saw it as Bestie, while it is in one of your private channels. The tab has the
same switches, **Remove from all** for its channels, and **Make my Bestie
again**.

### Choosing a Bestie

The account choice is read before the page decides what to show. With a saved
Bestie, reconnecting, inventory failures and missing-agent states remain on the
pinned destination with their own recovery; they never fall through to the
chooser. A successful account read with no saved Bestie shows **Choose your
bestie**, where the owner can select an eligible existing agent or open the
shared **New agent** dialog. Only agents on this device are offered for now,
and the chooser says so. Choosing or creating an agent saves it through
`main-agent`, then hands off to the canonical DM; like **Make my bestie**, a
choice here starts the agent with Remembers you on. When the saved Bestie is
no longer here, the page shows the same chooser in its place. Deleting the
Bestie saves none to the account, after reading the account again to check it
still holds that agent, so the page shows **Choose your bestie** rather than a
Bestie that is gone.

Builderlab no longer owns a separate Bestie setup, agent, Solo chat, or
selection path.
