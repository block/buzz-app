# Bestie

Bestie is the account-saved agent pinned in Buzz's left navigation. The
selection is the private `main-agent` record shared with Solo's default-agent
owner; this plugin adds presentation and a conversation destination, not another
selection store.

## Getting started

### Pinned conversation

When the account has a saved eligible Bestie, the sidebar row adopts that
agent's name and avatar and opens their canonical direct message. The canonical
conversation is the newest verified, unarchived, non-cached DM whose roster
contains the viewer and exactly that one other public key. A Solo chat, group DM,
namesake, unknown roster or archived/cached channel never qualifies. If no exact
DM exists, the page asks the shared direct-message service to open one after
rechecking that the agent remains selectable. If agent discovery fails, an
already-verified exact DM stays usable; opening a missing one still requires a
selectable agent. Known-archived agents and agents confirmed absent from a complete
inventory do not keep a pinned conversation.

The page uses the ordinary conversation owners for history, drafts, sending,
threads and unread state. Thread visits bind to their originating DM. Restoring
one after the Bestie or canonical DM changes retires incompatible thread visits
and shows the current Bestie's chat; it never reads an old thread in the new DM.
While that exact DM is promoted, Messages omits its
ordinary row and clears any old device-local hidden-DM intent. Replacing or
deleting the Bestie, disabling the plugin, changing communities, or losing the
exact roster match releases the promotion and restores the ordinary DM row.

The pinned row and Search Buzz destination show the agent's name and avatar.
Search adds **Bestie** as supporting text and matches either name, so the pinned
DM remains recognizable without presenting a placeholder identity. Agent rows
remain separate **New chat** actions; namesakes stay distinct by exact public key
and use readable owner labels before abbreviated-key fallbacks.

### The Bestie tab

The agent you made your Bestie (with **Make my bestie** in Agents) gets a
**Bestie** tab on its agent page while it runs on this device. **Change** picks
another agent and asks before replacing your Bestie. The tab lists Bestie's
settings, which are not set up yet.

### Choosing a Bestie

The account choice is read before the page decides what to show. Reconnecting
and incomplete or failed inventory reads remain on the pinned destination with
their own recovery. Once a complete read proves that the saved agent is gone,
the same chooser appears in place instead of sending the owner to another menu.

A successful account read with no saved Bestie shows **Choose your bestie agent**,
where the owner can search eligible existing agents in a picker with avatars,
names and short public-key labels, or open the shared **Create agent** dialog.
Known hosted agents and agents on another device remain eligible, but require
confirmation before saving: **Some bestie features aren’t available with remote
agents.** This also applies after creating one through Builderlab.
Cancel leaves the account choice unchanged and keeps any newly created agent.
Local choices save directly. Both paths save through `main-agent`, then hand off
to the canonical DM; this does not configure memory or check-ins for remote agents.
A finished agent deletion saves `agent: null` only when a fresh account read still
names that agent. Another choice already visible to that read is left alone.
This is a read/replace, not an atomic compare-and-swap: a choice made on another
device between the read and publish can still be overwritten. A cleanup failure
reports that the agent was deleted but its Bestie choice could not be cleared;
open Bestie to choose another.

Builderlab no longer owns a separate Bestie setup, agent, Solo chat, or
selection path.
