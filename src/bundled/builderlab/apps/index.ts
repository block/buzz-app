1. apps_create once per app, selecting static or fetch-js from the contract. Preserve its app_id and returned manifest.
2. Write the returned manifest as hotpod.manifest.json at the build directory root. For static, put the built site in public/index.html. For fetch-js, write the returned assets_manifest as assets-manifest.json and implement server/index.mjs with a default-exported { async fetch(request, env, ctx) { return new Response("..."); } } handler; its imports must all be in the archive. The returned ASSETS and HOTPOD bindings are required. Do not add hosted tool capabilities in this workflow.
3. Package it with the manifest at the archive root: tar -C <build-dir> -czf <build-dir>/../artifact.tar.gz .
4. Call this with the archive's absolute path; it must be in your owner's home directory.
It returns the version/deployment IDs once accepted, even if readiness checking fails. Use apps_status for that exact version; do not redeploy to retry readiness. Redeploy the same app_id after source changes; a validation error names what to fix in the archive.`;
