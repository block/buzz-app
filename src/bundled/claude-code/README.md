# Claude

Create agents that run Claude on your computer and answer you in Buzz. Each agent works in its own **Workspace** folder and can run commands and edit files on its own.

## Getting started

1. Go to **Settings** → **Agent setup** → **Harness defaults** → **Claude** to install Claude, then either **Sign in** with your Claude account (Pro, Max, Team or Enterprise), or paste an Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys). Buzz keeps the key in the OS credential store (Keychain on macOS), and native code gives it to Claude processes when Claude runs with the key. Security reviews always use the key, because they run in their own Claude folder, apart from the account sign-in.
2. Choose **New agent** → **Create a new agent**, and pick **Claude** as the **Harness**.
3. Mention your agent in a conversation to give it work.

Open **Settings** → **Claude** to see how Claude signs in, switch with **Use Claude account** or **Use your API key**, and manage the saved key. Focus or click the masked field, or use its chevron, to open **Replace / Remove**. Replacement starts blank and masked, with inline **Cancel / Save** buttons. Settings cannot reveal or copy the saved key. **Remove** deletes it from secure storage after confirmation; the menu is unavailable during replacement. Key management also works when Claude needs installation or an update.

New local Claude sessions and security reviews need a key again; a turn already running can finish. Agents on another computer use that computer's credentials.
