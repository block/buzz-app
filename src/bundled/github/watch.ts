// Pull request watches for agents: what one GitHub read says about a pull
// request, and whether that is worth waking the agent that asked. Code decides,
// not a model: CI finishing on the head commit, or new feedback.
//
// The wake is the plugin's (`ctx.agents.wake`), not a message: the agent is
// told it is data. So it quotes what GitHub says, check names and comments,
// each line marked as quoted, and the agent need not read them itself.
//
// Agents use the signed-in gh account, as their owner does, so GitHub cannot
// tell the two apart. A comment of that account that starts with 🤖, as an
// agent's do, wakes nobody; the owner's own comments wake the agent.
