// Pull request watches for agents: what one GitHub read says about a pull
// request, and whether that is worth waking the agent that asked. Code decides,
// not a model: CI finishing on the head commit, or stuck; new feedback; and
// what nothing else would wake it for on the way to merging: conflicts, a base
// to catch up with as the last thing in the way, auto-merge turned off, and
// being ready to merge. Recovering on its own wakes nothing.
//
// The wake is the plugin's (`ctx.agents.wake`), not a message: the agent is
// told it is data. So it quotes what GitHub says, check names and comments,
// each line marked as quoted, and the agent need not read them itself.
//
// Agents use the signed-in gh account, as their owner does, so GitHub cannot
// tell the two apart. Which feedback reaches this, an agent's own 🤖 comment
// included, is the GitHub comment authors rules' call (`authors.ts`).
