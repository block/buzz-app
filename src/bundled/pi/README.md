# Pi

Create agents that run Pi on your computer, with any provider Pi supports, and answer you in Buzz. Each conversation continues its own Pi conversation.

## Getting started

1. Turn on **Pi** in **Settings** → **Plugins**. Pi needs Node.js 22.19 or later on this computer.
2. Choose **New agent** → **Create a new agent**, pick **Pi** as the **Harness**, and choose its provider and model.
3. Mention your agent in a conversation to give it work.

# Pi for Agents

Agents run on [Pi durable](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/durable/README.md) in one Node
host ([`host.mjs`](host.mjs)). Each agent has its own SQLite storage, and each
Buzz thread or channel is one durable Pi conversation. Agents owns identity,
admission and signing; this plugin owns the turn after handover.

```sh
bin/pnpm exec vitest run src/bundled/pi
PI_DEPS=<installed deps folder> bin/pnpm exec vitest run src/bundled/pi/host.live.test.ts
```

The live test runs the real host on Pi's faux provider.

## Packages

[`launch.mjs`](launch.mjs) installs [`deps/package-lock.json`](deps/package-lock.json)
with `npm ci` (no install scripts) into a per-lock folder under Buzz's app data
`pi/deps/`, shared by every Buzz build. To update Pi, change
[`deps/package.json`](deps/package.json), then:

```sh
cd src/bundled/pi/deps
npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --omit-lockfile-registry-resolved
```

## Limits

- Pi's `read`, `write`, `edit` and `bash` run in the workspace with no sandbox
  or approvals. Buzz tools are `buzz_<name>`.
- Keys in Pi's `auth.json` must be literal: Buzz runs no `!command` key and
  reads no `$NAME` key. Set up a provider that needs more than a key with
  `pi`. Providers from Pi packages don't run.
- Runs left unfinished when the app quit continue at the next turn. A
  mention's run posts its answer or failure but shows no steps; its thread's
  session controls interrupt it. A watch's or timer's run is ended.
- On Windows, Pi's `bash` tool needs Git Bash. Linux and Windows are not yet
  validated.
