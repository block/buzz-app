// A port between pages in two webviews of this app, over the native agents
// port (src-tauri/src/agents_port.rs), which passes each frame from one
// page's webview to the other's. The link (link.ts) needs each message once
// and in the order sent: a call's answer must not overtake the state push
// before it. Separate sends can arrive out of order, so each frame is
// numbered and held until its turn.
//
// Either page may load first, and either may reload. Each page load is a
// session. A page announces its session once it listens, and answers a new
// peer's announcement with its own; until it knows the peer's session it
// holds what it sends. Frames name the session they are for, so a frame
// meant for a page that has since reloaded is dropped.
