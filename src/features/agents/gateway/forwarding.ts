// pushing the revision, opening only while it is still the route's, and
// sealing and closing. A route change pushes the new revision, which revokes
// the generation natively, and ends its process. Nothing here waits on
// readiness or re-reads a route to retry; only a native side that can't be
// reached is tried again, briefly, at the same revision.
