// Agent storage: each agent's settings, the owner's teams, unfinished setups,
// and the sessions agent types save. In the desktop app it lives in the
// `agents/state` folder beside the agent identities, one file per key, so the
// standalone agent host (`buzz-agent-host`) reads and writes the same state.
// Elsewhere, as in a browser, it is this page's localStorage.
//
// Storage reads are synchronous, so the app reads every file once before it
// starts, and then keeps a copy in memory. Each write changes the copy at once
// and is then saved, in order, to its key's file. Another program's later
// writes reach this copy only when the app starts again.
