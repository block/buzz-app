/** Offers the communities installed old Buzz saved for explicit import once,

 * session or join, so a relay that is unreachable fails only when opened, as
 * any saved community does. Only the communities old Buzz recorded for this
 * viewer's identity are taken; one saved for another identity, or that
 * records none, is not. Existing memberships stay as they are; a relay
 * already saved, not a secure origin, or saved or queued for removal at any
 * point while this ran is skipped, and each added one is queued for upload
 * as a join would be. Account state cannot prove there were no acknowledged
 * removals, so every nonempty import requires consent, even with an empty
 * device record or pending sync. A per-viewer marker, written after declining
 * or once the list is saved,
 * keeps a later removal from being undone; until then it holds the removals
 * seen, so a failed read or save tries again on the next launch without
 * restoring them. The returned disposer also abandons a read still in
 * flight. */
