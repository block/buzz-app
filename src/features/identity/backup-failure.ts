/**
 * Why "Backing up your key…" did not complete: the copy the failed page shows
 * and whether Try again can help. Native code names its own kinds and retries
 * them all on its next wake; `unavailable`, `interrupted`, `timeout` and
 * `unknown` are the renderer's. No message carries a service or IPC answer. A
 * leaf module: vite.config.ts validates the development seed against it
 * through Node's native loader.
