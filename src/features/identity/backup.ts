 * `BackupConsent` fills it in once the app opens. The revision is the session
 * the Builderlab plugin hands over too, so after a completed pass it stays in
 * the slot, at the cost of a fresh pass. On any other exit after the handoff
 * the slot is emptied, and Try again hands it over again; a settled pass is
 * not running, so that publishes nothing and the outcome stays visible.
