/**
 * A chip address: what a reference in a message actually *is*.
 *
 * The whole point is that a reference carries the identity of the thing it
 * points at, never the letters of its name. The existing client stores literal
 * `@Label` text plus a separate `label -> pubkey` map and re-matches by string
 * at send time; that is why two people with the same display name force a
 * 64-character key into the visible text, why a pasted label needs
 * network-fenced verification, and why editing a name silently unbinds a
 * recipient. An address has no second thing to drift out of agreement with.
 *
 * A display name is resolved *from* an address for presentation and is never
 * treated as its meaning. Renames and same-name identities therefore cost
 * nothing.
 */

/**
 * The kinds of thing a chip may refer to.
 *
 * The component understands five because the design draws five. Version 1's
 * picker only *offers* the first three — a message or link chip arrives by
 * another route (referencing a message, pasting a URL) rather than by typing a
 * trigger, so those kinds render before they are authorable.
