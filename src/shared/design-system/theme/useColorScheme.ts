/**
 * The one answer to "light or dark".
 *
 * This is a fact, so it owns no policy — but a fact still has to have a *single*
 * value, and this one did not. The hook held `useState`, which gives every
 * caller an independent copy: the shell's toggle updated the shell's copy and
 * nothing else. `<html class="dark">` flipped, so anything reading the class
 * through CSS looked correct, and the defect stayed invisible until a consumer
 * needed the value in JavaScript. `DockWorkspace` is that consumer — dockview
 * takes its theme as a JS object, and it kept receiving the light one on a dark
 * page, which is the same class of bug as the vendor-white-sheet it replaced.
 * `ComponentAnatomy` had already hit this and worked around it locally by
 * observing the class with a `MutationObserver`.
 *
 * So the value lives in one module-level place and every caller subscribes to
 * it. Module-level state normally has to register teardown for a community
 * switch; appearance is a property of the person, not of the community, so it
 * deliberately survives one.
 *
 * The class on `<html>` is written where the value changes rather than in an
 * Effect per consumer, because the DOM is one external system with one owner
 * and N subscribers must not each try to write it.
