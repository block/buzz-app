/**
 * The namespace rule, bound to the file rather than to a reviewer's memory.

 * `--color-x` is shared by every colour prefix at once — it defines `bg-x`,
 * `text-x`, `border-x` and the rest from one value. So when two roles differ
 * only by which prefix uses them, that namespace silently picks one.
 *
 * It shipped twice. Borders first: `border-primary` resolved to the text colour
 * and drew every hairline at near-black. Then text: `--color-danger` also
 * defined `text-danger`, so error text rendered in red-9, the saturated fill,
 * instead of red-12 — APCA Lc 34 on a dark panel, while `check-contrast` passed
 * because it measured `--text-danger`, a token no class could reach.
 *
 * Both fixes were the same move, so the invariant is one line: a text or border
 * role registers in its own namespace, never the shared one.
