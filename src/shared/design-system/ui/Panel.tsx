 * An independently legible workspace surface.
 *
 * Panel owns only the rounded surface: its fill, border, shadow, and clipping.
 * `joined` makes nested panels flush regions of this single outer surface;
 * layout owners supply the dividers between those regions.
 * Its marker does not suppress host defaults for native product/plugin content.
 * It owns neither a header nor content — those are composed into it by the
 * product surface that knows what belongs there. An empty Panel is therefore a
 * complete and valid specimen of this component.
 *
 * Resizing is deliberately not a Panel concern. A panel can sit in ordinary
 * layout, a future fixed composition, or a DockWorkspace; the workspace owns
 * live geometry, its resize seams, and their persistence policy. Asking Panel
 * to demonstrate a resizable arrangement would make a layout owner look like a
 * surface owner.
