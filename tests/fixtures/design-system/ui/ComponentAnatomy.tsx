/**
 * What a component is made of, read from the running component.
 *
 * The question this answers is "which token draws this part" — the one a specimen
 * cannot answer, because a picture of a control does not say whether that pill is
 * `bg-chrome-selected` or a hardcoded white.
 *
 * It reports the token and stops there. The value each token resolves to is the
 * token table's subject, and repeating it here made every cell two lines of which
 * only one was the answer.
 *
 * **It reads the live DOM rather than a hand-written table**, for the same reason
 * the token table does: a typed-out list of parts and tokens is a second source
 * of truth that goes stale the first time someone edits the stylesheet, and goes
 * stale silently. Here, a part whose declaration changes reports the new value on
 * the next render, and a part that stops existing reports that it is missing.
 *
 * The trade is that it can only describe what is currently on screen. That is
 * why each row names a selector: the row is a claim that this part exists, and a
 * missing part is shown as missing rather than omitted.
