              Fixed pixel text freezes against keyboard zoom and ignores the
              person's font-size preference. The current client shipped a
              message-timeline regression from exactly this and now has a CI
              guard rejecting arbitrary size literals. This ramp derives
              entirely from one virtual rem, so both dials work by construction.

            <p className="mt-1.5 max-w-xl text-body-sm text-secondary">
              A capitalised label is harder to read than the sentence-case
              version and reads as enterprise chrome. Section labels earn their
              quietness from size and colour — text-body-sm on text-tertiary —
              rather than from being shouted. There is no uppercase utility in
              this system.

      <Note>
        The Cash Sans and BlockUI type variables that appear in the design
        exploration are contamination from another Figma library linked into
        that file. They exist nowhere in any Buzz codebase and need no cleanup —
        only a decision not to inherit them.
